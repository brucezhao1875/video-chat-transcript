I'm so glad that we can meet today. I've heard that you came from many countries. Actually is not about one particular country. Dharma is actually with ourself and dama of Lord Buddha. If we have learned and practiced the things that we gain from it is the suffering transcendent but most people misunderstood even Thai people most ties don't really understand Buddhism we pay respect pay homage to different,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,4.32,Speaker
temples monastery hoping for wealth and uh progress in life and or to learn better in education. But dharma doesn't really satisfy those aims. Buddha answer one question which is to how could we live without suffering? I'm the first person to give talk. Katana said that if you give talk the first person you can talk anything is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,53.92,Speaker
fine for the the rest of the uh the rest of the speakers would be difficult especially would be a more difficult but it's up to him not my business. I would give give big picture to the rest of us. The main topics that I give talk is about self awareness. The second topic is about samata practice. The third topic is about practice. And the fourth topic is about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,99.64,Speaker
noble path and noble fruit. And the fifth topic is about nibbana in order to attain nibbana. It is the phenomena that we can transcend the suffering altogether and we can answer the question of how could we transcend the suffering the beginning of this path to transcendent suffering is self awareness is is very bizarre. People in this world never become self-aware. You're born with delusion. We live with delusion and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,146.08,Speaker
"die with delusion. What is delusion? Illusion in thoughts. Or if you practice dharma, you're deluded in. And you live in a world we drift away to see the things to hear to feel through the sensation of the body. is all about delusion or drifting away especially when you're drifting away through the mind which is when you drift away to think of things said that he never seen any dharma that more important than self awareness to have self awareness then it's the beginning of the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,191.32,Speaker
"dharma is the beginning to fight against the filements and attain the bana People in the world never really become self-aware. You can observe for example when you see images, people of walking, images of flowers, anything said ugly, our mind will drift away towards that object. For example, beautiful flowers. We our mind drift away to the flowers. Seeing beautiful girl, handsome man, our mind flow away towards those objects, beautiful dogs, cute dogs, our minds",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,236.52,Speaker
"whipped away to the dogs. Whatever we whatever we see anything, the might attach to those objects. And what happened? So whenever the mind drift away to the object for example see the form we forget about our mind and body. If we have the body forget about the body we have the mind we forget about it. You see this when you see my hand why I rest my hand. We have the body but we forget about our body. We have the mind but we forget about the mind. Our mind is being curious why I'm resting my hand. You never realize that your mind is is being",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,282.48,Speaker
"curious or your staring at my face that you pay attention to listening and seeing me. See, you forget about your body and mind. Some people uh sitting like this and sitting in different partes then don't really become self-aware. They don't know that their bodies have what the postures the bodies are in. They never realize what the mice like. This is when you're wandering through the eyes through the eyes to see forms and forget body and mind. When you listen to the voices, you understand the story of the singing song of the birds bird",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,328.8,Speaker
sharping. We we enjoying it and the flowing of waters we enjoying it but never realize how the mind's like and never knows what's the body is like we forget about ourselves see the beginning of when the day we born the amount of time that uh we forget about ourself is countless but for the time that we become self-aware is very limited. That's why I said that most people in the world doesn't most people in the world don't have self awareness. So to practice dharma to transcend suffering cannot be truly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,376.4,Speaker
"achieved because laba said that la said that self awareness is the beginning to transcend the suffering. If we can transcend the suffering we attended the without self awareness then we satisfy our definements constant when you want to see forms see images and we keep on seeing them we forget about our body and mind we never we know about them we want to listen to the song while listening the song we enjoying it some people got broken heart and feel miserable Then whether the mind is happy or unhappy, the mind doesn't know. It respect to the past",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,421.52,Speaker
"and enjoying things on and on. When you listen to anything, semi drift away to listen to listening. Sometime you understand it, sometime you don't. You're drifting away. E different way it mean meaning that you forget about your body and forget about your mind. Whenever you smell a thing for example we're walking and smell something very nice your m feel curious what's the flower it is why it's so smell smells so good. So you can uh buy the flowers and planet at your home. You pay attention to that or but you don't know that at the moment you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,469.48,Speaker
are being curious. You're being trusted in the smell. You forget about yourself. You keep on searching for that smell. Where is the flowers? What the flower it is? your body moving but you don't know. You forget about your body. Simply say that you have no self awareness. Have no self awareness. You forget about your body and mind. You keep on pay attention to the or the uh the taste the story of the mind or sometime the thoughts. Sometime you know the the story of the thought sometime you don't. You keep on thinking but you don't know what you're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,517.04,Speaker
"thinking. At that moment you forget about both body and mind. You don't know that you are being wandering away. People in this world live in delusion or wandering away through the doors way to taste dri away to feel think through the mind. Every time that we drifting away, we forget about every even though we have the body, forget about the body. Even though we have the mind, we forget about our mind. When if the mind we have the body and mind, which is dharma, if you forget about your body, then you won't be able",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,563.64,Speaker
"you won't have the chance to learn about the body. You won't be able to see the truth of the body. If we have the mind and you forget about the mind, Therefore, we we wouldn't be able to learn the truth about about the mind. Therefore, we need to train ourself to become awakened. Come back to the self awareness. Train yourself to be selfaware. The methods that we can that can help us to become self aware is that first try to observe yourself. Whenever you're absent minded, trying to be aware as soon as possible. For example, if you see something, kind of be self aware that you are drifting way to see things. For example, if you listen to something and you're enjoying it, knows that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,608.64,Speaker
"you're drifting way to listening to it. Keep on observing yourself. Keep on observing your mind. When the mind drifting away to see, no. When the mind drift away to listening, no. So, different way to think, no. So, it can drift away through six cents. eyes, ears, tongue, body and mind. But most of time you different way through the mind through thinking. You're thinking all day long all night all day and night. But we don't forbid the thinking because the mind's nature to think. You cannot forbid to happen. Forbid it to happen. You try to uh forbid to happen. Nobody can do that. Even noble ones can still think. We can think them too. But the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,653.76,Speaker
difference is that when the noble one think their mind doesn't wandering away but what but for normal for other people we are thinking and we drift away to the world of thought. That's the main things that happens very often. The second one is when you're drifting when you see if you're not blinded. If you are blinded then you won't have the mind wandering through the eyes. But for the people who have eyes they can see um they can think all the time when even when they are asleep they are thinking which is dreaming. In fact when you wake up you keep seeing things when you're drifting away to see,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,700.0,Speaker
"happens very often but it's less than drifting away to things when you're listening. If you're not deaf, you're wondering to listening things. You're thinking uh some sometime you're thinking and you don't listen. Uh sometime you see, you won't be able to listen but to observe this very carefully. The mind has nature to observe one thing at a time. While the mind thinking, the mind won't be able to listen or see. At the moment the mind if the eyes see forms the mind won't be in the world of thoughts the main job of the eyes to see",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,748.16,Speaker
"form while listening the mind will be listening. We can prove this by to go watch series. Not sure whether there are series in this country. You can see go watch the series in movies. When you see the image on the screen when the protagonist said, you listen to them. When the when their enemies speak, you're listening to them. At the moment of listening, you don't see the forms. You pay attention to the voices they're saying and you start thinking, trying to interpret",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,796.36,Speaker
"when when the actor said, you try to interpret interpret whether that character would fall the protagonist or not. When you're listening, you can see that your eyes is a little bit blurry. You can see things clearly because the mind keep on thinking because the nature of the mind is that you can observe one thing at a time. You can observe the L Buddha statue. You can observe the white Buddha statue. Right now you just see that at the moment that you pay attention to the body the Buddhist statue you forget about yourself. You forget about your body that whether you think that the body uh",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,843.8,Speaker
the Buddha statue is very beautiful and but there's some defects here and there that moment you forget about your body and mind. Therefore you need to train you to train to be self-aware. The method that we can train this mind is that first of all you have to meditate on an object whatever object is try to be aware of your mind can meditate on an object and try to be aware of your own mind. For example chanting mantra like budo budo Or you can chant any sort of mantra. Some people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,889.52,Speaker
reciting one time two times one equals two 2* 2= four. In Thailand we have letters and we reciting the letters. We don't pay attention to other things. We pay attention to our meditation objects on and on. And then once the mind wander off to think about the things and we try to be aware of the mind that wandering away to think or sometime you're breathing in good brea out go and you listen to you heard something you pay attention to that particular voice who is that and you pay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,936.12,Speaker
and you turn to that person and forget about yourself. So meditate on an object and once the mind drift away from that particular object then try to be aware of it. At first it might drifting away for a long period of time but after a while then it becomes shorter and shorter and whenever and after a while when drifting away you know so right away drift away no so again. Every time that you knows that the mind drifting away it will give rise to nondolution which is the self awareness. So we have to train ourselves to become selfare. To be selfaware is when we know that we are drifting away. We don't forbid the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,983.2,Speaker
"drifting away mind. We don't try to forbid it. Nobody can do it. We can tr test it right now. Do not think. Can you do it? No, you cannot the mind sneaking out thinking things all the time. It's drifting way to see to think. So the mind is something that we cannot forbid it. It's nonself. So we try to train ourself when drifting way knows so drifting way again knows so again very as much as possible ultimately then illusion or drifting way mind will shorten your knowing more often. Back",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1028.72,Speaker
then you might drifting away all the time and never become self but then after after you're meditating on an object one might drifting away you know so drifting away again know so again one day you might drifting away three time and know three times you might know only three times but the next day you can know 10 times at the beginning you have a few knowing mind but for for example 24 hours if you drifting away for wandering away for about uh 24 hours and know only one time. But after a while when you drifting drifting away and you know one hour at a time. So one day you can have the knowing mind for 20 time 24 times. So when am I drifting away? No. So when,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1075.2,Speaker
"I drift to see, no. So drift away to listen. No. So no. Then the delusion will be the drifting away will be shorter and shorter. For the pe for those who never practice, they're only wandering away only one time. They're driven away from the beginning from the moment they wake up and then they go to sleep. But when you keep on practicing then only after one hour you're drifting away and you know that you just drifting away. You just drift away for for a day you can know for about 10 times a day but keep keep on practicing drifting away.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1123.92,Speaker
No so again drifting away no so again even only one minute you know. So and then 10 second you will know and and then even just the mind moves a little bit you will know right away. So for the people who cannot practice da danding only one time but for those who can practice them they can drifting away countless times a day but they know. So we come to train ourselves to wandering away only a short period of time so that the knowing might arise very often. So you meditate on on any object and try to be aware of your own mind. If,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1170.0,Speaker
"you practice like this then you'll become self aware and if you can become self aware then we can train our mind. The next task, a powerful mind is the mind that is calm and peaceful. Most people don't have any power energy because the mind is busy at work. The mind gets tired. How do you re-energize your mind? So you bring the minds to rest with one object. It is called samata smat practice. Let the mind rest with one object while being",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1216.32,Speaker
mindful. You if you already having the mind staying with the one object but not being aware then you completely lost again. Most of the practitioners have this mind loss and do the smati practice and then bring their mind to stay with one object and staying dull and sleepy there. So samata when you do the practice you still need the awareness the mindfulness in order to do it you need awareness all the time otherwise the samata practice will be the incorrect kind of samati then your practice will not will be just the mind being busy. So when you have one meditation object and become,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1262.68,Speaker
"aware frequently your mind become upright and stable. So now when you want to gain more energy and power for the mind, you keep going back to your meditation object, you can use the O1. But if you want the mind rest, let the mind stay with the meditation object. If the mind is busy to see, to hear, to taste, to feel contact, to think, if the mind is busy running around, the mind gets tired and then the mind will be tired and not having enough energy. So let the mind rest with one object. For example, when I need to rest, I would just stay with my breath. Breathing in, put breathing out toe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1308.64,Speaker
"When I breathe in, put breathe out toe. The mind doesn't move anywhere else. The mind stays still with the breath. Stay with the mind doesn't do anything else. When the mind doesn't do many things, the mind will regain energy. That's the principle of samata practice. Bring the mind to stay with one meditation object continuously. Bring the mind to stay with one object continuously. The mind is the knower. The the mind is the object observer. So if I'm looking at this white flower and looking at it that flowers is being looked at that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1356.16,Speaker
one is knowing that I'm looking at the flower is the mind and the object is the flower. So when I want to practice calmness I look at the flowers. If I like it then you if you look at it and you feel happy you stay with the flowers and the mind won't wander off because you're happy and staying peaceful with the flowers being happy that's a principle of samata practice just looking at the flowers you can have the peace and mindfulness and calmness from it if you're going to try to control for the mind to stay still it won't stay still the mind doesn't like to be controlled So bring the mind to stay with one,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1402.96,Speaker
"object that is brings happiness. Emphasize it has to bring happiness. If you look at the beautiful flowers, you look at it and while looking at it, you don't pay attention to anything else. The mind stays with the flower. That's the mind stays with one object. The mind is one. Object is one. Staying together. The mind is one. The object is one. It stays together. It doesn't move to second, third, fourth object. That's how the mind becomes calm. During the Buddha era, there's one monk went to practice and their mind never stay",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1448.0,Speaker
"calm. So this monk used to be a ghostmith and when he got ordained, he stayed with Prasar. He was a young guy used to do a lot of beautiful work. So he thought that it will be full of desires and soar asked the guy to stay with the fall things that are dirty. So everything that comes in for example food that comes into the body when it gets through the mouth it's nice looking and once you spit it out it's ugly. Everything that comes out of your body is all dirty. Your ears, your eyes, your mouth,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1493.88,Speaker
"everything that gets discharged from the body is dirty. The sweat is full of dirt and dead skins. So, Prasari taught this student to just keep observing the body that it's full of foul things, dirty things. And then this monk disliked it. He didn't like it keep observing other dirty and foul things and the mind got irritated and couldn't become calm. So he was feeling very discouraged and wanted to leave the monkhood. He felt that he couldn't make progress because he couldn't get calmness that hasn't even beginning the wisdom cultivation just even staying calm. He couldn't get",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1540.32,Speaker
"it. So he wanted to leave monkhood. Just a moment before leaving monkhood, he had a chance to meet with Lord Buddha. And Lord Buddha said that now you have become a monk and you haven't really truly learned dama. So he just went to get the arms and he got this gigantic beautiful pink lotus. In Thailand, the pink lotus in Thailand are tiny and once the sun rises, it gets wilted. In India, it stay full bloom in the sun. So then Lord Buddha told this monk to bring this pink lotus to put it next to his cottage. He's really",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1585.8,Speaker
"satisfied and happy and put this pink lotus next to his cottage. He looked at it and it's so beautiful. It's pink. It's red. The mind likes beautiful things. He looked at the beautiful lotus. The mind stays with the lotus. And the mind kept observing the lotus that is beautiful. So he forgets about everything else. And the mind is just staying with one object, a beautiful lotus. That's a samata practice. So that's a secret of samata practice. You need an object that the mind is fond of. The mind likes and will but it must not create any defilements. It doesn't stimulate um defilements. You cannot look at a porn pictures and then you won't be able to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1631.44,Speaker
"get calm. You'll be even more busy. So you're looking at the flowers. It's beautiful. Keep observing it. The mind stay with the flowers. As the mind staying calm with one object, that's called samata practice. The mind gets to rest. It doesn't move anywhere else. So that's the secret of the sumata practice. Choose the right kind of object by staying with my breath inside reciding put out. So I get calmness from it. That monk that I just told the story about he likes the red lotus. So he gets happy after observing and staying with the great",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1678.64,Speaker
"lotus. So when you know how to practice, you know to you don't need to copy anyone. Observe your mind to see which object that when your mind stays with it, your mind becomes happy. Each person would be different as his student to consider and observe the foulness. Some people would become calmness getting rid of the desire and the lust. But this monk didn't like it. So Lord Buddha asked him to observe the pink lotus and the mind doesn't move anywhere else and the mind becomes calm. So that's the secret for calming the mind with the samata practice. So choose your object",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1724.6,Speaker
wisely. Which one would make you stays calm and happy? Observe yourself. See what object that you stay with. Your mind is happy and calm. The happiness that arises from samata practice. So happiness is the near cause for samata for samati. So this is num one of the main rules of the practice is happiness is the near cause for samati. So if you have any meditation object and your mind keeps wandering off it means you need to look at something else find something else don't be greedy don't have the desire wanting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1770.28,Speaker
to be calm and peaceful then you won't be able to when I do initially trying to do this I breathe in put breathe out toe when the mind is calm I knew so when the mind moved out I knew So when the mind is quanimas I knew so when the mind gets irritated I knew so just kept breathing it's okay the mind can get anything into any feelings and then but you stay with the breathing when you look at the flowers the the mind might gets the attractions to the flower it's okay having the mind staying with the object if you can do this your mind will become calm when I want to do something it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1816.24,Speaker
"simple for me. I just observe it, observe my object. So practice until you become good, until you become proficient at it. You can stay with the flowers and you can stay calm. When you really good at it, you can look at anything and you can become calm. Initially, some people can start with just one candle and you observe the fire. Some people just love the fire. Some people likes to play with fire and could set fire for in the house. So some people who like the fire would light the candle and observe the fire and how it's flickering and you become happy and the mind will stay with the with the fire. It doesn't matter",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1862.96,Speaker
"whether it's good or bad. It's okay. The mind just stay with the fire. That's a mata practice. One is mind, one is object. They stay together. I used to practice that is related to fire or water. I used to stay by a river and as the water flows the water ripples. So you could see these tiny ripples, it was bringing happiness for me. So once the mind became calm and I stay with one object and I became happy and then the mind became calm. So the object could be anything as",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1910.16,Speaker
long as you stay with it and you're happy. But that object must not stimulate any defilements. You cannot watch porn and say it brings happiness because it stimulates the defilement or you can scold you cannot scold others and then your defilements would become stronger. Find a meditation object that would not stimulate defilements. Just observe it. Keep observing with the normal mind. observing that meditation object and the mind will become calm and then you will gain the energy and the power of the mind. How you get this supernatural mind power is through the samata practice. So next step it's about the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,1955.44,Speaker
wisdom cultivation. Samata would brings you energy and power. So the next step about the wisdom cultivation it's about learning the truth about the body and mind learning the truth about ourself what is called ourself it could be separated into the body and mind once you when you want to learn about the truth about the body and mind. So in order to do so you need the power the energetic mind powerful mind. If your mind is too busy and doesn't have any energy getting lost here and there all the time that way the wisdom will,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,2002.24,Speaker
"never arise because the mind is too busy. It's too scattered. So bring that back bring back the mind back to our body and mind. And once you keep observing it and know the movements, the stability is getting stronger and stronger. Once the mind moves, you will come, you become aware of it. At some point, the mind becomes upright and stable. Once the mind moves, you will know. The moment you know that the mind is lost, the mind is that is lost disappears. And then the knowing mind will arise. the knowing minds that luminous and happy will arise. There's another approach to this in order to get the upright and stable mind is to get into",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,2048.4,Speaker
Janna. But just this during these short courses it's hard. It takes a long time decades in order to achieve Janna. It takes a really long time. So if you've never practiced this there is an easier way. So just observing the mind just like when you practice the awareness once the mind become upright and stable that is the moment that mind is self-aware. So as you have the meditation object and your mind moves to think you know so then if you do this frequently and your mind will come back and stay with yourself because the moment that is lost it wanders off you know so you become aware of yourself again,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,2093.8,Speaker
"and awake again and again and the mind becomes upright and stable. You become truly awake. The rest of the world are not awake. Everyone is dreaming. During sleep you dream. In the middle of the day you daydream. Everyone is just lost. So when the mind moves you just know. So keep doing this. When you want to rest, bring the mind to stay with one meditation object that makes you happy. Stay until you re-energize. Step back. Don't stay with the object. And then practice with your meditation object that the mind is lost. Just know so the mind gets upright and stable. Once the mind is upright and stable rooted in awareness then you can",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,2138.8,Speaker
"do your wisdom cultivation. The moment that the mind is rooted in awareness you see the separation between the mind and the body. As you could see the mind and the body. This is the first step of wisdom cultivation. As you could see the body is one thing. The mind is another thing. After all this, you've listened to me so far. You started to gain samati. Can you feel the body? Can you feel it? That it's being observed. The body is being observed. The mind is the observer. Seeing the body sitting, you see the body turning left and right. You see the body moving. The mind is",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,2185.2,Speaker
"observing. The mind is observing. Just like you observing somebody else's body. Just like observing a robot that can move. Can you see that the mind is move? The body is moving. Can you see that the body and the mind are separate things? Continue to practice this. You have many days. Keep doing this that I just suggested. Keep doing in this in steps. And when you get lost, you cannot differentiate the body and mind. Go back to calmness samata practice. When the minds gets re-energized, come back. You see that the body is one thing. This body is just like one of the flowers. Just like initially that you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,2232.6,Speaker
"practice. The mind is of an observer and the mind observe the flowers. How do you cultivate wisdom? The body is like the flowers. If the mind moves to the body, you just know so that the mind has moved to the body. So now that means you're not being aware anymore. Once you know that the body moves to the body once you know so the body the mind would jumps back out as a knower and you see the knower is one thing. The knowing mind is one thing the body is a separate thing. So if you have going down the road of Janna practice you could see the body and the mind. The body disappeared the world disappeared. That's only knowing mind. And then you will really really",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,2278.6,Speaker
"know that the body and the mind are completely separate thing. And they will no longer merge. They will be completely severed permanently. If you not don't have the ability to get to Janna, you won't be able to do this. So keep practicing to become self-aware.

key. As long as you have intention to practice to intention is actually the karma which is the process of working of the mind. The karma is actually the realms or the fabrication.

The body is just like a light coal cold at its own fire. Who's going to pick it up? The mind will let go. That moment that the mind truly understand the truth that the body is full of sufferings because we don't see it yet. You guys see that it's not full of sufferings.

So once you get a stream entry level, your precepts will be perfect but then the mind still moves around but not as fast as frequently as normally does. The eyes of the sense doors are full of sufferings. So the non- returnturners who see that they will not be lost through all the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the body. So there is nothing. So if you have an open wound on",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,3749.2,Speaker

You don't want anything that comes to contact with the body. Any image, any sound, any smell, any taste, any touches, you don't want any of these. There will be no desire for a non- returnturner because it's a non- returnturner knows it's full of sufferings. You can have a shirt that costs thousands of dollars. is still to cause sufferings.

"same. He can move. The mind doesn't have any greed or desire, any sensual context that comes through the body. There's nothing that is interesting anymore. That's the knowledge, the inside of a non- returner. He will not a non- returnturner will not be interested in indulgence in any comes through the physical sense doors some sound some image some taste some smell I still prefer it for us so you still have the defilements in the sensual pleasures so you have the sensual desire",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,3840.52,Speaker
so it's the desire there for physical sensual touches or displeasure in these physical touches uh context. So a non- returnturner will now no longer have any greed for any sensual pleasures because the body is not us. That's called intermediate wisdom. This much inside is still considered at the moderate or medium level. So and the fourth round when you go through these cankers the fourth round told me that you need the fourth time you see that the cankers will separate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,3885.8,Speaker
out once you practice you see that in the middle of your chest something will flutter inside your chest you cannot stop it that your eyes see the image you have something that comes into contact something inside your chest will flutter Anything your mind moves to think your mind something in your chest flutters you get tired of it. So that just the cycles is circling inside your chest. Everything arises from the middle of your chest. So keep observing this until the fourth round that the canker separate out the mind that used to be busy inside your mind inside the chest.

It gets rid of the world. The mind itself is getting thrown away, discarded. both the minds the objects nothing is being clinging to. So the mind is truly liberated. This is",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,4022.28,Speaker
called it's theana the first time the first level of impana the mind is free from all the defilements the defilements will never be able to reach the mind because all the fabrications cannot enter the mind. The mind of an arahan it will not be clinging to any of the objects. So for us the mind see an image the mind jumps to get clinging to the image to the sound to the thoughts. So when you do the practice you mind is getting attached to the meditation objects. So the mind gets attached to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,4067.32,Speaker
something. So the mind is truly liberated. Will not be attached or clinging to anything. There is no object to be clinging to there is no birth no rebirth. So when all the aggregates separate out so then so the first nana is free from all defilements no clinging no attachments there's no tainting no impurities and the final stage when the body is dying,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,4112.4,Speaker
"that's because I haven't experienced this either If I've experienced this, I won't be able to teach you. But I listen to the masters who told me when they are going through the nipana of the aggregates, they observe the mind and the matter. Some would just observe the body. Some would just broaden the awareness throughout the whole world. What the moment the mind lets go and let go of the mind itself that's the kind that is no longer",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,4157.48,Speaker
aggregates some would just observe the earth the water the fire Lord Buddha when he was transitioning into the dead he goes through everything staying in Janna outside of Janna is clearly throughout the eight levels of Janna and it gets to level 9 but he didn't die in so he comes back out he stays he goes his life ended between form and formless Don't search. I try to look for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,4204.92,Speaker
"something something between form and formless. Once you get there, you will understand. You can know for yourself. A lot of masters observe the body. We could see the body is full of earth element, the wind element, the water element or any parts of the body. If you keep observing this when it comes to that moment when you are dying the mind will let go of everything you'll be liberated and depart. So today I started from the beginning to the end. What's good about",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,4252.08,Speaker
"nipana? So what's good about nipana? So the first question you have to answer is what's good about the aggregates? The aggregates bring sufferings. But when you're free from aggregates, you don't have any sufferings anymore. There's no happiness that can be compared that you get from getting happiness from money, from family, from love. Everything is not truly happy. So nana brings true happiness. There is nothing else that will be piercing you. Happiness other kinds of happiness cannot be compared to the happiness that arises",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,4298.12,Speaker
"from achieving nipana. And it's truly nipana. It's happy because you are free liberated and you get true peace. Peace doesn't occur anywhere else. It's inside our mind. When you have the true freedom when you have the true peace, how happy can you be? There's no need to dream about anything else. Come back to yourself and you will find this. You will know this for yourself. That's it for today. They asked me to teach one for one hour. I went over time a little bit. Sorry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUHIWY8oQs,4343.6,Speaker

mind to be with the world without become scoring like the world what a that most Buddhists not are not interested in Dharma practice they never taste Dharma and didn't know and they don't know how wonderful the dharm is a lot of people come to visit temples in order to pay H much to uh statues and trees that irrelevant,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,51.68,Speaker
to Buddhism at all only a few come to the monastery that teaches Dharma most people come to visit Dharma to uh do do different things that's depend on especially that's depend on people spiritual faculty most people have weak spiritual faculties that why they want to depend on things that worldly people do like they do this on the purpose of be getting rich or getting some benefits out of it they aim for those things actually it has some benefits but it Grant the most important,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,98.96,Speaker
benefits that Buddhism can you can offer are not interested by a lot of people therefore we have to take action to train and learn DH take it seriously we don't play uh because we have limited time and time pass by every day master has been fading away 40 years 5 50 years ago in the time when I was searching for Masters and learning Dharma there's a lot of Masters back then especially in the northeastern part,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,147.84,Speaker
of Thailand there are lot of Masters good Masters even just one route you can come to visit many temples with good Masters but nowadays in the same road master that used to be there they used to be there no the master no longer there anymore that's why back then I like holidays I like to go to ISA nor eastern part of Thailand or in northern part of Thailand to shingai or Shing raai to visit moners but most of the time I went to isan because there a lot of Masters when whenever I visit there I was very happy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,194.28,Speaker

a in in at night there are uh the dark sky and the animals surrounded the different sounds of the animal it's very peaceful environment keep training myself to be able to live uh humbly and most of time I spend on cultivating mindfulness when the times come I do sitting and walking meditation and chanting as well for the rest of the time I try to Cate myness in daily life to do that to to cultivate um cultivating my finish in daily life is very important that's why Master L which I didn't live in the same era as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,290.4,Speaker
but a lot of Disciples of L used to tell me that he taught doing a lot of samti can slow your progress thinking a lot you'll make your mind scattered the heart of the Dharma practice is cultivating myness in daily life how many hours you can sit a walking meditation but if you cannot C away myness in daily life there will be slim chance for you to get the attainment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,338.28,Speaker
while practicing I I do a lot of uh culating mindfulness sometime I don't want to do meditation because it's I thought it waste of time but for some time it goes by the smart isn't enough and I couldn't cut with wisdom that's why smart is very important as well but most of the time I do my fitness cultivation in daily life because Master Lun taught me to observe my mind to cultivate my in daily life and observing the mind Corless combined together we can practice in daily,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,383.44,Speaker
life whenever we see forms when I see form Whenever there any feelings Strang happen takes place within our mind when our I see for example a beautiful flowers to my like there are there is a change within our heart so we have the mindfulness to recognize that change when our ears hear sound and there's a change within our mind when the sound takes place for example people scolding us blaming us and our might give rise to Aion we have the mindness to recognize that when the no smells good a and the might likes it the heart likes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,428.64,Speaker
it or sometime the heart very confused what kind of flower it is whenever there are curiosity arises we don't see the flower we observe our heart that our minds give rise to curiosity we see that Curiosity arise and Fall Away sometime we smell this order and it's very not very good the mice becomes irritated know the irritations that's how you Cate mindness in daily life simple principle is that you can let the six s dos make contact with the world as naturally add it is we don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,475.48,Speaker
forbet it to happen whatever the mind things we cannot forbid it to happen because the mind is a or nonself sometime you want to think of good things but sometime you think of bad things like departments and Cravings but whenever the Mind thinks negative the heness will take place the mind will gain some burden gain some weight and become compressed and tight we have to have the mindness to recognize that the M now is Mal longor the M bad but whenever the M develop wholesomeness we have to recognize that as well for example whenever see the Masters and the mice produce some raptures in PT instead of only observing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,521.08,Speaker
the master we have we should observe that our minds develop some P or raptures or listen to Dr the minds gain some happiness do not just keep on listening on and on knows that your might develops some happiness that's how we Cate that how we train ourself and it's very important a lot of people ignore this part and they don't interest are not interested in practice differently and they ignore mindness in daily life even though Master said that this is the heart of the Dharma practice which is to cultivate mindfulness in daily life if we want to have the mindfulness in daily life we have to train ourselves to observe our heart whenever the I see,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,569.72,Speaker
forms and any change within our hearts like giving rise to Happiness and happiness wholesome and wholesomeness we have to have the mindfulness to recognize those phenomena for example see see beautiful women the might develop greed knows know so we don't have to act indifferent or try to I'll try to compress the Mind Till There is no feelings at all that's not how you Cate the mindfulness in daily life but that's all focusing you're all focusing in daily life and the mind will become stiff and tight like this monk your mind is tight and stiff you are overusing so we have to train to observe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,617.0,Speaker
our feelings whenever they I see forms if the Happiness and happiness and and homeness arises be mindful when the ear is s nose smells the body feels the my things whenever homeness and H Happiness and happiness arises be mindful it all happens within your heart and when you think and it give rise to happiness inhabitance and wholesome wholeness be mindful it's not difficult but most people ignore it for example some uh a car cut cut cut in front of you and for those who not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,665.24,Speaker
practiceing who doesn't practice for those who don't practice day would see what who is that but for dharm practitioners we see the version giving rise to our within our heart when people cut in front of your car and you are sending your mind out to see and give rise to aversion that's some marent thoughts that arising so to practice dma is actually not very difficult because we don't try to suppress ourself what the mind is like we know so know it as really is it's not difficult at all but it's not as simple,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,711.48,Speaker
as you think it as well because we not familiarize ourselves with observing our hearts it's difficult because we don't have this uh Habit to know to observe to observe the mind will no longer be difficult if you have this habit I don't practice a lot I I don't really train different methods but when I was young I only get the Comm and send my out to see different things and there's no substantial to it but when whenever once I met Master L he taught me to observe my mind I try to observe my mind I don't focus on the mind or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,759.28,Speaker
guarding the mind to see whatever arising at try to look at it that's not right that's incorrect whenever you have intention to guarding the mind the mind will become tight and stiff that nothing resurfacing therefore you shouldn't uh try to look at it uh beforehand you let the feelings arises and then no so knows that feeling arises already do not try to uh wait for the phenomena to arise otherwise it will become ster and nothing there that's when you're controlling your mind not observing your mind we have to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,804.56,Speaker
train if you can observe your heart proficiently enough then you'll know that Dharma practice is no longer difficult because you got the most important aspects of the Dharma practice which is your mind your heart to practice dma is actually to train our heart not the body for example walk in meditation some people want to train your body to walk in a particular manner actually that's not right we don't we don't try to train the body to walk in a beautiful manner actually you can walk any manner at in daily life you walk but the heart of Dharma practice is that your mind taught that whenever you get the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,851.72,Speaker
mind you get the DH if you don't get the heart you don't get the D why because the DH arises from within the heart what are the DH there the first thing is UN wholeness do you know UNH horness arises from the the body the hands the feet no it arises from the heart What About horseness It doesn't arise from the hands or the abdomen or the breath is actually arises within the heart what about the attainment fr the frun doesn't arises from the mountains or rivers or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,898.84,Speaker
the body actually within the mind if you keep observing the mind and having the mindfulness to guard the mind and take care of the Mind whatever the mind it is just knows it as it really is then you'll be able to see that all kinds of feelings change all the time constantly whenever the I see form the my changes ear he s tongue taste the body feels the my things feeling change keep on observing like this it doesn't have to be good good or bad,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,944.2,Speaker
Master one master said that whether good or B whether good or bad that are all evil this evil or inali is something that you shouldn't take God you shouldn't belong to you it worth it doesn't worth belonging to you is something that you shouldn't take it or take position of it that's when that's in the level of wisdom cultivation but in in Morality good and bad are not equal but in wisdom cultivation we don't practice D for the purpose of having,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,989.2,Speaker
good things because good things isn't permanent or happiness or peacefulness they are all impermanent we train ourself we practice them in order to see through truth that the Mind changes all the time sometime it's good sometime bad sometime it's wholesome sometime and wholesomeness they're all subjected to the three characteristics while observing the mind or heart there are the three characteristics that happens across these phenomena it's actually the common factors of all the phenomena all the condition information both abstract and physical parts which can be categorized,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1035.76,Speaker
into three things first impermanence it used to be a not there anymore or is suffering the second is suffering for example happiness arises and is a pressed to break apart a lot of people when you see me and you talk to me and the raptures arises and that raptures Whenever You observe it you'll see that the raptures is suppressed to go away it it start to fade away and then fall away and it's also non so as well or another whether the mind is happy and happy wholesome and wholesome you cannot choose it you cannot take control of it that's the truth it's the common factors among the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1082.12,Speaker
informations which is the abstract and physical past that all subject to the three characteristics there only one thing that beyond the three characteristics which is the niana niana has no birth if that if it wasn't born then they won't fade away they don't fall away it won't fall away whether the things is physical mental part that are arise and following so we have to have the mindfulness to keep on observing the truth within our body and mind one day you understand that all things that arises within our perceptions stay for a while and then follow away ultimately,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1129.24,Speaker
keep on observing like this I spent Master taught me to observe my my mind I spent s months in order to do that but I mistakenly observed the mind for about 3 months my trying control mind to be still and don't have any thoughts at all actually can do it for example I can meditate and then the might become still and empty and comfortable and once I revisit the master Lun again and I and L what's it what is it my life and I said that the mind is marvelous it can fabricate a lot of things but it can control it to be stilled and empty and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1175.96,Speaker
Mas said that I said I told you to read the mind not the Fab not fabricating the mind we observe the mind like I I told you we just observe it as it's really easy in a relaxing way for example at this moment a lot of people while listening what you think their mind is happy or unhappy can you real can you recognize whether the mind is happy or unhappy is not difficult at all or you can observe the body do you know that the body is sitting is it difficult to observe that the body is sitting is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1221.28,Speaker
it if it's difficult then you all become bizarre you can go uh consult the psychiatrist Dharma is very direct and and open whether the body is breathing in or breathing out do you need to um change the mind in order to do that you don't have to make the Mind still to be to be able to do that likewise observe the Mind You observe like the When You observe It You observe it like the body just know it it really is do you know what the mind now is happy or unhappy are you confused some people are confused whether the m is now happy or unhappy a lot of people becomes confused,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1267.36,Speaker
some people are not confused but couldn't see couldn't read it because they are deluded and drifting away to other places of the m is very SLE and delicate and very Swift We have to cut with the tools like myness to Able toer we shouldn't try to slow the feelings with our heart so that the slow mindness can observe it we shouldn't adjust it we shouldn't change it example A lot of people some people walking meditation in a slower Pace in order to for the mindness to keep keep Pace but actually the m is already uh fabricating,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1315.04,Speaker
a lot of things and taking birds and fall away a lot many times definement is not slow as you're walking or you don't have to make the mindfulness or the mind to become slow and empty and low and blank don't do that just try to be aware as they really are when I I only spend four months to observe the mind and understand the mind the mind has nature to arise far away and nonself I could see the three characteristics of the mind then I submit homework to report the progress of my practice to and said that you can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1361.92,Speaker
help yourself now you don't have to learn from anywhere else just learn within your heart and you can um be on your own You Can Depend yourself depend on yourself and another Monk uh asked me from another Temple asked me that I and he heard that I submit homework to many Masters and a lot of mas compliment me a lot and that mon curious and ask me that you are a lay person but how could you practice to this level mon took years 10 years took,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1407.8,Speaker
decades two decades in order to achieve what you achieve and I said and I answered I practice all day long and he's confused because um CU you you have a job you have to do the job How Could You Cate how could you practice all day long uh and I I actually Cate my fin in daily life whenever I have to do the job I pay attention to the job the mindfulness and wisdom with the job that's not the time for Dharma practice but outside the job outside the work whenever I use the body I um I can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1456.28,Speaker
practice without when when I don't have to think I can practice and in suin Province even the um the driver of a a car they can they can observe the body and mind as well even even the vendors in the markets they can practice them they are very bright and bright and uh and and the fights are very low how could they practice dhma they don't have time to sitting or walk in meditation all day long they did this by cultivating mindfulness to have the mindfulness to feel the body and mind on and on sitting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1503.84,Speaker
uh and selling vegetables when the then other people comes to visit him buy vegetables they are happy that this woman happy she knows that she happy the weather is really hot and the vegetable is very uh the the even though the the vegetable is um wor out but her mind is very uh ftiz very energetic and her mind gain some possession The Possession which is the noble possession if she,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1551.12,Speaker
practice when she practice like this a lot of people are very poor in terms of uh wealth but they have the another kind of possession which is the noble possession they have uh the they have moris nowadays uh people in The Province like uh people in Bankok they are they are deluded in the world I practice like this in the evening I do sitting meditation I don't really walk in meditations because my house was made of wood so whenever I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1599.64,Speaker
walk it make noises and disturb other people that's why I do sit meditation a lot and I train myself to observe my mind as much as possible before I going to bed I drink a lot of water why because when I I need to pee at the middle of the night when I need and when I pee I drink a lot more water again and do sitting meditation if the Mind still uh dark I won't go to sleep if the m is not bright and luminous I won't go to sleep because it's still deluded with delusion I very stricted to dama,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1646.36,Speaker
practice of myself I keep training till the Mind becomes more uh smart whenever I whenever I wake up and the mind becomes so bright so I can go back to sleep and then if it right so I start to getting smarter than definement are sitting meditation for longer hour so but you have to be P patient there are two things that there's two mistakes that people do wrong the first is the self modification the second is sensual um delus uh ensal uh Indulgence,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1691.64,Speaker
self modification is overusing yourself controlling your body and mind like this monk he's very confused he want to come ask me he want to ask me question that he practiced for a long period of time but why he's not progressing because the mind his mind was very tight and stiff at the beginning but now his his mind was more relaxed and become more self-aware that's how you start to become to practicing but if you keep on overusing how many years pass by there will be no progression therefore you have to observe your heart more often so that you attain some good things which is Dharma if you understand D you won't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1741.32,Speaker
fight against other people you won't uh quarrel to other people and um discuss with the DH with other people because because dhama is something not to be quarrel or fight if you learn dhma and you feel that you knows a lot of things and you uh talking d a lot but you can see your own definement that's not good because you can't see can't read your can't observe your own mind it's not difficult actually most people serving yourself your mind that mind when today I giving talks and all the DH that I need to offer is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1788.04,Speaker
already been done so you have to take action and see whenever I said that I finished talking and your mind is like finally is to it's very obvious it's cuz you see that the m is a little bit Giggles the giggles giggling feelings arises not just giggling and like um infants they keep on gigling and don't know themselves that's the the manner of the infants they don't have the mindness and don't know anything like um when I I observe the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1837.24,Speaker
monks some monks uh talking very loud and and and Giggles very loudly because you cannot laugh out loud like that because you don't have the mindfulness toer actually there's a fun feeling arises within your heart that's okay but you shouldn't lack mindfulness you can be happy do not have to reserve to look suffering all the time like that no When You observe suffering it meaning that you observe the body and mind Happiness and happiness these are all in the Heap of suffering those feelings are in the Heap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1885.2,Speaker
of suffering as well and the Aggregates of suffering he un observing is not difficult dma is delicate and subtle uh from different level in the beginning of ser your own heart wisely M said D in short phrases not like me if I imitate his style of teaching you wouldn't be unble to understand because your uh spirituality is very low and you and you are lazy as well anybody's feeling that you're still lazy don't raise your hand don't raise your hand it's very obvious here you don't have to raise your hand at all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1932.36,Speaker
if there still uh stop from from practicing Dharma you are too callous you think that H I want to play games for 1 hour that's callous because while playing games you won the game and you may shock to death that's when you can us so you don't have a break even just a small break from dhama practice the def kick him right away defans are really good at this Mas taught very simple and short fres for example if he want he wanted to teach your mind to become stable he only taught one sentence do not send a m out,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,1982.36,Speaker
when the mind is sending out is the might s out through the six he said that do not send the M out but whenever the might send out uh you cannot forbid it but you shouldn't send send it out by yourself like for example you send a m out to see the mooding the the boun and you come to see the B P even they're sleeping all the time when you see the mooding uh your mind uh sent out to mood and when you die a lot of people will become the hippo and a lot of people come visit you to see you as a as a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2029.6,Speaker
hippo so don't do not send the M out is that do not having the craving intention to search for the essential Pleasures which is the uh the essential Pleasures but the nature of the mind is to send out the the Mind itself has the nature to send out but whenever you are send out be mindful this is very important this is what but when you it's only one sentence but whenever you expounded the D you describe the DH can be described in many sentences and then the mind will become stable and bful and no one I have this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2076.2,Speaker
no since I was 10 years old when I went to visit Master he never taught to send my out he further my Pro further my practice by saying that uh you should have the wisdom to see the image image as for example now can you close your eyes and then open the Mind Open the Eyes you see the image whenever you see that image you for example you you move,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2122.04,Speaker
your head and you found beautiful women or see the tiger just know like the I see forms you can't see the image of forms that you see whether the eyes see good or bad images you cannot choose to observe the mind use the wisdom to see the image as the IC form we don't choose the image we don't see we don't choose we don't get to choose the objects to see or to perceive likewise the Mind cannot they didn't get to choose the Optics to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2170.32,Speaker
perceive just just know and observe as we are is um wisdom we we know not like just know like this we don't know in a blank way we know with wisdom with stable mind so that the wisdom can arise we pass the lesson of don't send out when the Mind become stable so that we can gain wisdom to see the mind all wisdom has the proximate SC of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2216.2,Speaker
the right is why I have to pay a lot of attention into the right the Mind needs to be stable and on the base that so that you can C wisdom so you have to have the wisdom to see the objects like the I see forms first of all you have to be aware of whatever Optics arises within your heart no so for example Horseman and hors the second have the another wisdom to see that all kind of things that the Mind knows are subed to the three characteristics happiness and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2261.4,Speaker
Hess andom Happiness and happiness that imper you have the wisdom to see the objects like the I forms it is like this do not just focus on the it's like when you in the in the room and you only stare at the candles it's not like that you have the eyes you can see anything as it is whenever the feeling arises with just let it let it be and and and try to observe it that now Z is Happ happy and happy whome on whome keep on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2308.68,Speaker
observing on and on to you understand that whatever arises it arises naturally and it all falls away why is it anything that arises why don't see why don't I say Happiness and happiness good or bad because it actually everything that arises they all need to fall away so I don't say that happiness suffering arises and Fall Away GRE delusion aversion arises far away I don't say that because first of all you might able to see like this that these things arise and Far Away each phenomena arises and far way but whenever the wisdom is fully cultivated it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2355.92,Speaker
comprehend that the wisdom in in Noble past concluded that every anything that arises it falls away that's when you understand the Dharma and gain the stream entor then you keep on practicing like what you do but the morality is fully this m will become stronger and keep on cultivating widom for the stream enter the mality is fulfilled it's full but the SM is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2403.28,Speaker
Slim it isn't like the stream enters has SMY like other people in the world and the wisdom is very slim he only see three character from time to time this once's returner he his is medium but and the wisdom still slim has more stable has more stability he he doesn't we he doesn't become rless from many,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2448.4,Speaker
hours he only Restless short period of time very short time in a netive time these can become uh for non- returners he can let go of the body and he let let go the six sent and six Central objects the things that make our mind rless is the central PR whenever you can let go of the six they can let go of the six Central object as well the Tes and unpleasant feelings towards different objects are n the Mind wouldn't send out,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2493.92,Speaker
to through six it's that makes their have the fully SM the M become dominant and stable the mind didn't send out to see observe the central pleasure and the wi that wisdom is medum the non- returners has the medium level of wisdom you can see that all forms all bodies are full of suffering nothing else there only full of suffering but why this wisdom is not ultimate because non return still has one wrong that Once the mind is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2540.8,Speaker
fully trained the mind will be happy they striving for the happiness in meditation they still attach to the formless and form whenever they have the have the wisdom and you could see that actually the mind is the suffering if he could see that the suffering then that would be the end of the Samara cycle he will understand thoroughly the dependent origination and cleanse the ignorance what is the ignorance they ignore you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2587.12,Speaker
don't you don't know something they cannot you don't know the ca of suffering they cannot Cate that they cannot realize the sensation of suffering the body is very easy to observe that it is the suffering however the my is very difficult to observe as suffering even the my that is in the mediative states that very difficult to understand that is suffering before up to this point you have to fight,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2632.96,Speaker
first uh do what I said first of all hold five precepts and do form meditation so that your might gain some strength but the heart of Dharma practice is to cut with mindness in daily life if you can do like this then you w't be a way far you will be far from the attend if you're only good at doing citation in the room that then it's still far from the Fran what today's talk is the essence of the D practice like Master said if you doing SM it will a lot it will make it slow but if you c withdom a lot then it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2678.32,Speaker
will become scattered the heart of D practice is to cultivate myess in daily life so can I give can I have some time to break yeah I felt a lot older back then when I taught many friends when I was a late person we taught I taught,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2723.8,Speaker
until morning back then I spent taught seven days and then four days and half day now only two days a lot of people comes to the temple but someday I need to take a break who first number one you're off,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2770.08,Speaker
practicing formations by walking in the morning and evening in daily life I serve the body moving I'm not sure whether my mind is stable and ready to Cate wisdom or not said that now you're controlling the mind because you feel that you're controlling the m at the moment can you walk up front here for me to see imagine that this part is a catwalk do not let the master down because your master is very good at walking meditation that's good good it's good that you have the mindfulness if you like mindfulness then isn't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2817.04,Speaker
useless you're a little bit stiff because you're submit hting over you see that you're send my out can you see that you see that the M off BAS can you breathe do not interfere with the Mind breathe as naturally at it is and see the body bre breathing now you're drifting away think about the things just keep breathing and was natural one the my drift away and keep breathing it isn't on the base yet good m it's start to come in you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2863.76,Speaker
feel that it's different number two the Mind need to be stable like this if the might become empty and outside and still that's not working it just take person on residing there number two I practice form meditation about one and a half hour walking meditation and in daily life i' like to observe the body movements I drifting away for a long period of time sometime there are weaing bits in the middle of my chest is it rising and falling away said that correct it's that we weing bit happens on his own we don't command it to happen good continue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2909.12,Speaker
practicing number three I practic inations by sitting for about 30 or 1 hour a day in daily life when when I move I be aware of it I see the body breathing and Bo breathing out though as a home base I like to transcend the suffering and hurry the craving a lot and forget about everything and the mind things that cannot enjoy anymore and the mind can let go a little for a period of time but then it take back again Paul said that you do what you do Master already uh taught you well but now the M sent out can you see that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,2955.36,Speaker
and the m is not on the Bas yet can you see that how how could you make the M on the base you can't do that because the m is nonself whenever you you can see the the mind sending out it will come back to with base on its own and in fact if you be aware of the phenomena as there we are in the present the will be on the base on his own for example the M drifting away to think about the things and you know so the M will be on the base on his own right away because whenever you have the right mindness to be aware of the body and mind it will give rise to to the right SM the might become stable now is in it isn't correct,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,3002.0,Speaker
because it's tight good very good it doesn't Tain it just tainted your Master reputation number four is very pressured because don't wants to change the reputation of the Masters you don't have to be afraid you are very good number four foration I walking for about 30 45 minutes and shouting as well in daily life I try to observe the body movements and my working and hting Bud or the body breathing that I should BU as optimation I I'm not sure whether how to make,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,3049.0,Speaker
my wi cultivation of my in daily life better if you don't like said that if don't like put you can use other object imitation Master told me to uh bu that's why I sometime pass on to my student to knowing buddh actually any object imitation is fine if you be with one object imitations for a period of time then the mind will give rise to peace actually your practice is good very good actually good so I I think this one is very um like a dark,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,3096.52,Speaker
horse so but he hidden in number four for another person you're if you the craving to be good and this will slower your progress because it makes your mind unnatural number five wait a second number seven you don't have to act like that because you're already good do not try to struggle and breathing breathless like that um is already good actually everyone he good all the four number left very good you don't have to worry number five I practice in meditations by,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,3142.48,Speaker
walking and sitting meditation about one hour one or two hour a day before go to sleeping in the morning I use the body as an observation in daily life I like to observe the my body that change I like to have control and interfer with the phenomena I see that the world there's nothing in the world to attach but scap it Paul say that what you practice is good do more when you see that the world is nothing nothing to attach actually that's not true because your mind still attached to it it's craving to yearn for it you keep on learning till you can see the true suffering of of the world and you see that there is no substance to it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,3187.8,Speaker
the world is only deluded to people who are deluded good but now your mind is heading out number six I practice inations by sitation for about an hour a day with the my with the with the my with the breath in daily life I like to be with the breath as well and have the myness in different postures and I like to I I see that my I like that the peace and calmness my mind doesn't like to get away from the calmness sometimes they agreed and red letters met with the um Sam I don't I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,3233.68,Speaker
cannot control it I think the quality of myti is better because it becomes calm without having to control it is good but you need to as well is developed in order to Cate wisdom if the Mind likes the no so no ex that directly you see when wisdom is not as calm as doing SM while the might cultivating wisdom the might will work as like scatteredness but you have the mindfulness for the for people who satisfi with the Communist they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,3282.0,Speaker
won't make progress by wisdom they lose some chances like they want good things but they want best thing but they only good get good thing and they satisfied with that can you do for me could you see that move away to theide of meditation can you see that no no this one and then you Cate the wisdom in thei if you like you can C with this wisdom inside thei can you start again do not have a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,3328.64,Speaker
lot of intention like it more relaxed you have too much attention intention be so normal get get back is not like in the beginning when a my C wisdom the my is not um in different I activat the my your mind to C wisdom the Mind becomes stable when they might want to see different things,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,3374.56,Speaker
if they might weathering like this you can come back to do the C to become calm and stable again and then relax it and observe the working of the mind you see that might towards the object meditation now you might drift away to the world of thought no so no like this so during meditation you can Cate wisdom when you are you can as well because you see that the Mind s out to think that's how your life so while meditating and you see that the might phone towards the object meditation like the breath you see that non sself of the mind that it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,3420.44,Speaker
flow it drift away on its own you have to train yourself so that you can C with wisdom but do not uh spoil the SM this this SM is very good number seven I Do foration by observing the movement I like to do c meditations because this becomes relaxed but I don't want to get attached to it so that so I don't sit meditation I feel that my my is not continuous can Paul said that you have intention to observe the breath we only observe the body as it is do not have the strong intention,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,3466.44,Speaker
exerted what you practice is actually good you can do this on and on then the last person should we take some break first okay you can go on number eight I practic ination by chanting for half an hour and then sitting meditation nowserving the bra the body breathing the Mind becomes bright and the know my rises in da life like the body moving the when the Mind develop aversion Devolution and greed I know so sometime I forget about myself the mind I'm not sure whether my mind can separate the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,3514.36,Speaker
Aggregates that you can do that but you have the habit to in direct the minds to be still you can do meditation if it's still it's still on its own you don't have to control the mind to be still otherwise the might become tight and stiff you see that the mind is a little bit tight it's tight because you have strong intention therefore you can do citation with this Cal or not that's fine and it will become on his own so that will be good you see that you're starting to to controlling it again just be aware of this this is when you waste your time let you direct the mind to become,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,3560.48,Speaker
still you meditate whatever the mind is like or do no so now the mindfulness is a little bit uh loses strength the delusion takes no so increase the intensity of self awareness no like in this level keep on knowing like this and whatever there are any changes within the mind or so when you get out of the Mind try to observe the body contemplate on the body the nails the hairs the flesh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,3609.56,Speaker
so that should be enough for today it's already 10 for you master you stuck in the you direct the mind to be still you relax the mind so that it can work observe the body use the body as you op take meditation whenever you move sweeping floors see the body working as the my as as the no otherwise you won't make progress it'll be still and no many no many no matter how many years pass by you will be still like this because it's stuck in the Stillness,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e-HoCO62s,3660.04,Speaker
how are you doing you've been listening to dhama for a few days this is the fourth day you might have understood some of the principles of D to some extent and today actually there are D talks about principles already so today I'm going to talk about the my experience of Dharma practice and what are some of the uh mistakes that have been that I have done,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,11.16,Speaker
for some people who especially for some people who made the same mistakes that could use this as an example for those who practicing incorrectly and diligent in practicing and doing a lot like the times that I used to practicing correctly and dly doing it doing a lot of it and I have no I had no idea that I was practicing wrong it it was so incorrect that I need to stop practicing at all I stopped um D,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,59.52,Speaker
um for a practice and in order to for my mind to becomes natural again it's natural states of mind is that it is normal and natural when you start practicing we tend to take action do something and we take action doing it but if you start practicing and you haven't be able to realize or recognize your mistakes therefore you tend to do things that you would be able to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,105.44,Speaker
do it like previously when I started to become interested in D practice I my I was in middle age at the age of the middle age of my life and I read a lot of drama books Whenever Wherever I saw drama books in bookstores I went to different booksto SED by some D books sometime I understood sometime I don't sometime it's too difficult to understand because some of the contents are in Bali language so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,150.76,Speaker
it's difficult to understand but I try so many times so many books 20 30 bity and I try to comprehend it because I think that if understand it then I would attain the DH I spend days and days I I live in world and once I want to understand something completely I try to listen and read and analyze and memorize them therefore I read the more I read I become the more confused I become I don't know how to find a way to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,196.28,Speaker
practice DH all and one day one of the one of my friends gave me the book of once I have been reading for about a year and I and I got a book of and then it just clicked the one things that comes to me that is that no no M no matter how much you rate it's not going to be enough no matter how you analize the books and contents of DH books is not going to be enough but we need to take action to practice but how I still have no idea I still don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,242.24,Speaker
understand how I just knew that that old people back then when they went to temples and they sitting meditation closing their eyes and things still that's why I try to do the same but I couldn't see a thing I just want to see the pain pain in my back pain in my chest um then become scattered as well we I Tred to looking like d practitioner sitting and doing hand putting my hands in a proper way but I don't know how to practice really but once I got the book of I think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,289.84,Speaker
that while reading I think that that is a way this is the way but I still have no idea who the is I don't know what Temple he belongs to so I tried to search for L PA for about half a year half a year nobody knows where he is cuz he just um ordained for not for long and nobody knows that where he is because he becomes he do he do some some seclusion so therefore I try to go to different temples and monasteries and school practices to dama practice because I want to know what's what happening,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,335.48,Speaker
internally so I went to visit different School of practices and they did a lot of SM smar practice and I have learned that I need to sitting still and have a still mind but the problem is I couldn't be still because to mind is not the nature of the mind to be like that therefore But ultimately I found him I found someone told me that he was in that Temple um and then I felt that that's what there was one thing that's arising without any intention or creation which,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,382.16,Speaker
is the faith or confidence once I met him I found that I'm so faithful I'm so have confidence um a lot of my parents always like to make marriage and I tend to follow them but then once I met at first not so many people in the temple just only five or 10 people at a time so tend to P out phenomena for example you wonder you wonder of to think of other things could you see that and like many time he pointed out this kind of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,430.28,Speaker
phenomena so I thought to myself that I shouldn't be uh wondering off to think of other things so I tried to do that and become stressful but I can't help it I can't I don't understand much so I Tred to practice myself more and more practice more and more for about two months and I submit the homework and I said that I couldn't forbid myself to think uh sway his head and said that no no I don't want you to forbid the thinking I want you to know the mind that wonder of the think and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,475.4,Speaker
then start to become more understanding but then I try to when I go back home I try to maintain the mind to be still again then the might become struggling because the because the nature of my mind is not like like to be still it's like a monkey jumping here and there so because I think that I'm practicing the B try to control it but it's un is unsuccessful and become stressful as well therefore give me another homework which is to shining budo so I came back home shining budo try to make the Mind becomes with the buddo and but it's not there it's not with a buddo it will,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,521.96,Speaker
wonderand after to other things just second or two second just one off to other things it's very scattered as a matter of fact when you come to learn Dr or you try to come to practice Dr most of us we have a problem that we don't like when we become scattered we feel we feel that we have to do something with it to make it not scattered and we think that if it becomes it will be correct scatternet is wrong but actually the nature of the the the nature of the mind is different actually you just know once you taught me I seem to understand it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,568.6,Speaker
when I go back home I just do completely different opposite um so completely opposite um at first while he searching for school practice there was some of the friends that uh went to learn from from different School of practice therefore I like to uh go as well there are no back then there were no causes like this in for that that in the path of but there are back then there are no causes like I need to try struggling for fighting causes uh from others practices I try to find my tutor uh for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,616.24,Speaker
the D practice and I thought that myself that oh my mind is is great there's happiness there has raptures and my mind was so great I I thought to myself that it is good I think it's good because I like it I like that the Mind prod some raptures and happiness so when I went to visit and asked me what did you do and I was like I went to courses dama courses and but I actually I don't understand understood what I don't understand what kind of question is that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,664.28,Speaker
um what did you do but actually instead of just knowing it I make action take action to do something with the Mind interfere with the mind but I don't still don't understood I I don't understand what he meant he said it's wrong the mind is wrong back then he never really go into details into Dharma practice he just said that you're doing wrong but when back then I just have to get home and sleep on it sleep on what what I made mistake what kind of mistake I made so I went to another courses from different another school of practice again and submit homework to again and said that what did,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,712.48,Speaker
you do and I said and I realized that there's something wrong with my practice actually I didn't still understand that the answer is within the question ultimately he he asked me to come and I and he said that I would like to ask you something and I said yes please so I be became worried what did he want to ask I don't know what what did he want and I don't know whether I can do it or not so I became worried and but he said I just asked one thing can you not attended courses because every time that you came,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,759.12,Speaker
to different courses you do you did different things so I quit going to courses from quit going to courses when I went to the temple and there are a lot of birds and I sitting and listening to the drama and I I heard I heard the bird sharping and he pointed out that can you see that your mind flowing towards the bir shping and can see it I couldn't see because my mind isn't awaken I heard the bird sharping but I couldn't see the characters of the my running towards the bir chirping because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,805.48,Speaker
my mind wasn't at that quality to be able to see that like in this morning could you see that the bir there are a lot of bird sharping could you see that the M flow towards the that voice that's first sharping because that contact making Through The Eyes you'll be Wonder off through the through the ears some people could see that if you practice for a while back then I have a lot of opportunities because there very few people who come to study with Paul and every time that I went to Temple I everybody get a chance to submit homework to directly like people will line up and he will P out um while while,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,851.04,Speaker
practicing what kind of phenomen what happened that the student couldn't see he he will point out for each everyone but I couldn't see it I couldn't understand it I still confused but he tried to teache that now you wonder off could you see that stuff like that but I I was a beginner I'm not expert at that I couldn't see it but then after a while when I start keep on practicing so I start to be aware of those phenomenas that He pointed out when when you couldn't see it but it's okay but try to memorize that mind what my life this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,898.16,Speaker
is this that what that PA said so when you come to practice on your own when you see that phenomena again you start to realize that this is what Paul called this kind of phenomenon is what as called I never study the theory of the dharm so I don't understand some of the terms that has been used by L Paul then I kind of struggling practicing DH I was scattered so much and that is in my,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,944.88,Speaker
nature and they try to search for peace and calm and he taught that this the smti can be categorized into two two things the first one is the object scrutinize things and the second one is St kind of SM but I couldn't observe myself that I couldn't see myself I couldn't understand myself that I'm um scattered delusion nature and my mind was jumping here and there and I couldn't do focus on one thing once I do sitting meditation it becomes I tend to do that focus on one thing in fact I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,992.0,Speaker
couldn't do it and I could understand myself could know realize that I can't do it some people who could focus on one thing to becomes a single mind and you can enter J and you can walk this path this is for the people who can do smarter but for those who cannot do smarter practice instead you use the wisdom to proceed your practice that's a he've been talking about this for 100 times but I I couldn't do the SMART practice it left me no choice which is to use the wisdom least my,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1039.28,Speaker
practice once the myness arises then this small smarty will arise as well I knew I understand this what I know understand what he tried to say but whenever I do citation my mind become overing again I understand I see but once take action to practice I do it I did wrong and I couldn't see it I couldn't see it myself doing wrong I didn't know it was wrong that's what my practice for many years at around that time before I started to uh becomes in the past actually the first three years I couldn't he said that your mind is not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1085.96,Speaker
awakened I couldn't be self aware because I tried to do a lot of things um to make the Mind becomes good for the teachers and master admired me but every time that he every time he said mean that I you don't know how to practice yet for sometime I feel disheartened anyone feel disheartened before I feel disheartened I feel discour but one things that helps me to still walk in the walking this path of DH practice continuously is the faith of confidence that I still have the confidence in DH of Buddha have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1133.56,Speaker
confidence in um my M the Masters no matter how discouraged I am I still do form meditation whether it's right or wrong I still doing it so I start I start with practicing incorrectly the first the very important things that I practicing correctly is that I don't know the nature of my mind and I try to do the things I couldn't do it happens for quite a number of years that happening like this till I could accept that I couldn't do the Comm so through the moment whenever the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1180.52,Speaker
mindness arises I use this kind of but my mind still for with C for so sometime it's still going to overusing again but onever it enter the overusing phas tend to be aware of that it's kind of rough path that I did till I become so aware it's kind of get I could ultimately I could get out of the world of delus of of thoughts once I can get aw of that face whenever I do walking,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1226.08,Speaker
meditation I will observe my body and most of the time I had over on the feet I get stuck on that habit to overcasting especially on the street and it become stressful a little bit but not to large large extent like before before I my my mind was heavy so heavy because it was forced it's stressful therefore it there's a characteris of being stiff tight Rosy if the mind was like this then you couldn't you wouldn't be able to become self aware because it becomes so stressful till it becomes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1272.36,Speaker
unnatural but I I I'm not aware of it I knew that it's awareness I I I didn't knew that um it was stressful like that I knew when the consequence arises which is when my mind is tight this compression there stuff like that but once when I do form meditations the M tend to overing again then I try to be aware of it and then it start to be aware on its own uh and I I quit doing it and then I start again start a new um every time that it happens I start again if I start,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1319.6,Speaker
again by noticing whenever I did wrong there will be consequence and I can sense that consequences through the heaviness the mind that is not natural not free not not free later on told me first when I went to Temple I went to friend I went with friends whenever admire uh some of my friends,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1364.88,Speaker
that you can become sare and he skipped me he skipped me he don't say to me at all and my mind was so sad my mind was so disheartened I felt that Master admire a lot the rest of the people but but me so my mind become sad and he pointed out that could you see that what what's theise like in that moment my mind just startle and awakened it knows that the mind is so disheartened and sad to the last extent my mind is very um sad and um not um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1410.88,Speaker
once when it news that the might becomes awakened and it could see that the S is gone and there instead BL [Music] that the first time that he point out and I could see that every time that he point out the phenomenon it means that he knew that this is this moment you could see it and I saw it I start to get to know it and it take quite some time till I become awake again so whenever you feel that you want to be awakened very often then you try to do formal meditation lot of formation whether it's going to be awaken or not that's none of our is it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1456.64,Speaker
the mindent we cannot control it later on I start to see more subtle phenomena for example Wonder off the things of other things for example the feelings of like sad when we parted from the loved ones these are the normal things that we could feel when we do we kind of overwhelmed by those feelings through it is something that can be noticed very easy but Wonder off the things wondering off from my op it's takes time it takes a lot of time to see but once the my wonder of the thing and I could see it then it becomes awaken the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1504.64,Speaker
reason that I could see it because I did foration I forgot to tell you this when I shining budo and I I F so much that my mind become headache my head become headache and so instead I used the body breathing you see the rising and falling of the body and I I see see the breath and Bre and then my Wonder off like M you jumping off to the word of God then I became become self aware I I could see that the might just now went into the world of thought um once I could see it then I realized that what he's been telling me for many,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1550.2,Speaker
years uh this is the phenomena that he wanted to point out so I start to practice correctly in the right path and so instead of trying to make the mind to become with the breath and try to make it calm so I knew that it cannot be achieved what the thing that I could achieve is I knew when it wonders off so I tried to observe this Wonder off things and no so wondering again no again why do I keep observing it I could see it in daily life I still working I was still working and one while working I used computer and and my mind was submerged into the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1595.44,Speaker
computer for a long period of time but after a while I start to see that yeah oh that that was drifting drifting away the mind's drifting away but it needs to drift away because we're walking if you're trying to be sare you can be working I I need to do my livelihood so I need to work but I just know as much as I can but we I don't try to make attempt to practice while working so I thought so I could observe wondering away and know so wondering wondering away I know so back then I was a kind of person,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1640.44,Speaker
who who opinionated about what's right and wrong I kind of righteous I'm very righteous what that this is right this is wrong whenever other people do things you should do this you should do that what is different from what it should be that's going to make me dissatisfied so I never knew that I am angry natured very Fe I just knew that I know I knew that I did the right things every everyone needs to follow this discipline,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1686.2,Speaker
and practice and I knew that that this is the right it could be described in other term is that you're sucking goodness you're attached to the goodness whenever you did things that incorrectly according to your opinions I'll become angry when I practice then I realize that I will be angry with that person and this person again because that that and those person those people didn't do what I think is correct so I start to be able to observe myself that I'm angry natured I'm very um easy to irritated agitated so once you saw it um and I started,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1733.64,Speaker
to from I started to observe the bigger ones for example intensify over hatred intensify hatred like people talking things that I didn't like I become angry but what about the mild annoyances I couldn't see it even just a little bit for example someone put a cup on put cup with the eyes on the table without the placeholder then I will beit agitated because the water will dripping on the wooden table and caused the stain so so I toore him off so I start to see myself that I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1779.44,Speaker
angry natured and a lot of agitation and there's um and try to destroy everyone just like that so Master said that you need to have the morality the precept the five precept but I realized that I I kind of misconduct about the speech through the speech quite often before coming to practice D I never be able to um maintain the five precept especially the fourth precept which is about the misconduct through the speech because I'm very angry nature first of all therefore I try to um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1827.12,Speaker
talkless and but observe instead of talking more I observe the version that rises within my heart it's like you put a fence and the might will struggling and suffering because I couldn't Outlet all diversion by talking so I try and observe it I keep observing it then it disappears I can I at that time I didn't see in terms of impermanence it just pay attention to other things so it's gone but up to one point I want to tell you that for anyone who are angry,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1873.2,Speaker
you try to notice that whenever you have quarrel have discussion with anyone else and you they talk bad things to you and you'll memorize That Thing Once once the incident's gone after a few days and the mind will remembers and recognize will recalls those memories and if you fabricate the aversion again the incident has long gone but we still suffer because aversion keeps circulating within your brain and it not going away it's go not going anywhere like when in the morning I like to take a morning walk which their love garden and Beau,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1918.48,Speaker
flowers but my face very bad because I keep kept thinking about people who scolding me talking bad to me my face looks very Furious um which is quite contrast to environment which is so beautiful which can uh can calm my mind but it couldn't calm my mind then it start to becomes better because I see the wandering away I try to think of other things but then it will come back to think of this thing again no matter how hard I try to forbid it to happen it just keep on thinking whenever I don't want it it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,1966.4,Speaker
just keep coming back whenever I try to push it away the minds get attached to that thing whenever I want to push it away so I keep observing I would think it think again think again a version arises again and I once to keep observing it after one point I used to be able to see the phenomena where when my weather off things of other things in it lost in the world of thought and once the the story come my mind kicks in I could see that might on off the things and the might just get out of world thought it becomes sare middle way to the world of thought but before if it done thinking then the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2013.2,Speaker
version will arises but before but then if you m aath and there's no aversion the might still one world of thought once you know that you're wandering off to think then the F will kicks in and you become awakened and there's no aversion for the people who are angry nature you becomes calmer because the mindness is the one who can outp def if you are their contacts and keep and they keep scoring us there will be a version of Rises at that present moment if they talk to us in a bad way at that moment we just trying to be aware of those aversion that arise in the present but the aversion afterwards,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2061.0,Speaker
that make our lives suffer for a long period of time it happens because you keep on thinking about it it's circling within your head producing the aversion so now I know what kind what the characteris of the my that is wandering away if you could see that you would be able to observe the mind that escaping towards others centors which is the same character of the my wandering away so through this through experiences of D practice consistently when you're wandering away and know so this is the ultimate Dr,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2108.32,Speaker
practice to the open you could do it but if you couldn't do it that's fine that's okay you keep on practicing and then you will start to get to know a lot more phenomena once you see it more often the might will recognize it it could memorize it memorize these phenomena and the mindfulness will kick in and you start to improve in fact it's a same same thing I teach every time to talk about my story is something that I have passed through it myself so I like to tell you all how I have reached this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2154.44,Speaker
part that's it who want to know more initially the first part is hard the Paul said this easy and I will tell it in my heart how easy is it it's so hard so difficult to pass to the first stage the first stage is to have the automatic mindfulness When You Reach automatic mindfulness it become easier automatic mean it work on its own before you can reach this automatic stage you need to bring it to learn phenomena then mindfulness will arise,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2199.8,Speaker
when I remember those phenomena firmly clearly you need to see those phenomena a lot you see a lot if you practice frequently regularly and then you see a lot of phenomena if you practice a bit then you return to the world you won't see it frequently enough so you cannot remember or if you prce to almost good then you return back to the world and you don't compare to it like uh uh a broken broken container water container you fill the water with it but that's leakage leakage a hole a hole in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2246.76,Speaker
the container the water flow out if you are not consistent not regular in your practice it will be like a leak cont it there's a lot of leage to flow out all the time so if you want to reach the end of suffering you need to dedicate your time dedicate to your practice another point that you help a lot is you don't forget the practice in your daily life that is the mindfulness in daily life if for your pral formal practice you can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2292.6,Speaker
when you work you need to get up early in your work and commute a lot of traffic to your work there's not enough time to practice and in the evening when we return from work you are tired if you sit you sit and sleep and and for younger younger practition easy for old people like me when I was 50 it's hard it doesn't have energy so when I practice practice I get sleepy I what do I get I get the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2338.12,Speaker
discipline when you practice with sleepiness is a discipline to keep practicing later I feel this is not enough practice formally in isn't isn't good enough it's too tired when there's lot of traffic in the evening I I feel exhausted I get sleepy all the time so I change to wake up earlier normally I wake up 6:00 and prepare to leave for work I change to wake up at 5:00 5:00 is very good for me there's no one else waking up in the house it's just me alone in the house no one water me I wake up 5:00 and sit and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2385.24,Speaker
walk and walk and sit and switch between walk and sit it depend on your resolution that you need to be resolved to practice if you don't practice discipline in practice motivation to practice you will have excuse oh I'm so tired it's too early wake up just an excuse just definement that will disate you from practice regularly so I I start waking up at 5:00 so uh my habit it's not easy easy to calm down it's a lot of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2435.16,Speaker
scattering so some someone someone asked me should I go to the temp to practice at a temple because told me not to attend courses if a temple that will require you to to join the activities it will be difficult eventually I found one Temple that the the mons are very kind just I can I can I can practice on my own there's no engage engagement with any activities so I went to that Temple and I felt stressed because it's a forest temple that is no electricity I need to light up the lamp,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2481.12,Speaker
and the candle the problem is not actually the lamp or the Comfort I'm Str up there a gecko gecko in the in the cottage I fought a friend of Geo I asked the none uh is that any Cottage without geckos Cottage had geckos do you want a lot or a little a few or a little uh so I need to choose to choose the cottage with the fewest getos and I hire the the the temple boy to catch them away I was so afraid of the geckos so those Temple boys catch them and tell,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2529.2,Speaker
tell him not not to kill just just move him away so I get the CES then those geckos return they return by itself I don't know how to do it love to stay at the top and I asked I borrow net the net the mus net if you have a CH for me so when I I see I saw the geckles I feel fearful fearful scary I see the scar and the fear the fear I felt okay I I accept you can stay with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2578.48,Speaker
me just you stay without engaging with me you you stay on your part and I stay on my part don't fall down and it knows so it stay quietly it doesn't bother me at all at the end when I turn on the light later that there's electricity in later years initially just just lamp and candle but later years there are some electricity the light electric light lamps lamps are good because it's too dark to see go it makes sound it make noise so I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2625.08,Speaker
know with the L then uh at first I I am not patient that I need I need to control everything to manage get go so that this cotage is suitable I manage things around me later I am more uh accepting and simple simple to live simple to eat whatever I has I what I have I can eat and I can tolerate and another part another side this just for me to secluded move away into a quiet,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2672.52,Speaker
world so it change change the context the contact and whatever your experience is new new experience makes you easier to to be aware the forest M Forest Temple is very a forest lot of trees a lot of Nature and my mind become more more nature of the mind it go to the calm nature of the environment to to induce the mind to be calm from the mind that is busy and and wor now it calm down,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2722.28,Speaker
and get out of the uh the habitual World left the old habit behind into a new environment I will feel I will see the phenomena more clearly in the world there's so many contact and phenomena from side and South and and tou but when I move to a secluded quiet place and and Cal those death will induce my mind to be calm as well whatever come up in the mind can easily observe it's easier to observe and I could practice,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2772.32,Speaker
better but when I return from Temple to home all those progress is return to the same those uh those achievement are expire and return back to the normal world then I use the technique go back to recharge the battery occasionally my mind was still dependent on what come up in the environment contact of the vibration or the influence afterward when PR I practice more and more it is getting more more capable to calm down even in uh ADV wore environment busy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2820.4,Speaker
environment then I I don't need to go to the temple anymore at that at that point whether you stay in the forest are in the the shopping mall your mind will be calm that's one point when I practice a lot of walk meditation and be aware from the walk meditation I notice when I go shopping and and it's pointless to go shopping I don't get anything from shopping in the past I go shopping and see oh I really love this I really like to buy this and when return I I have two bags returning from returning home but when I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2867.6,Speaker
practice mindfulness more uh engage with body and mind not engage with the external world too much and I've and it become pointless to go shopping if you feel that shopping is not so enjoyable like in the past that's one indicator that so my life is getting simpler not excessive one and most those one are excessive one not not something necessary as I practice more those result the the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2913.28,Speaker
consequence the side effect of the practice objective is the end of suffering but the side effect is to have a more simp simpler life simple life you know simple life you see and when if you follow the definement you be aware of those definement so you have uh easier life to live until one point could uh you could be so similar to amongst in your in your consumption you will consume simpler and you might get,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,2960.56,Speaker
simpler let me see the clock oh it's not one hour yet talk on various topics I try to insert T and [Music] practice the format of the practice the object of meditation like you sit and meditate you use the breath as the object for the mind to to observe when the mic go off off for the breath the object it's lost is out of your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3014.36,Speaker
radar that's when you are wandering off and then return back to the bread and restart a new c one again initially is it's annoying when it go off again W off again I don't like that it w off deeply we all love we all yearn for peace calmness is unachievable a few days ago we we discussed in the small group it may be possible to act in peace and calm many lifetime you would need many lifetime or 100 life times to achieve uh easy peace,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3059.92,Speaker
easy Cal at that time all the master are gone so for now if you choose a good object for meditation you can practice easier but if you insist that you want to have uh have a super knowledge uh extraordinary power of seeing vision and and intuition Go to Heaven and Hell call this toys if you want these toys you need a lot of time without your accumulation in the past it will take very long it is now your choice your choic whether you want toys or want end of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3106.0,Speaker
suffering some of those who get toys because they have accumulated for many lifetimes we don't know how long how many lives but if we start this life you need to spend a few more many lifetimes or maybe even many Buddhas have got gone until you achieve those toys I myself want have the same feeling and when someone else told me oh they saw heaven and hell I also want to see heaven and hell I want to to those Heavens want to use my astral body to travel to Heaven until one point I need to choose I I have freedom to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3153.64,Speaker
choose with whether we we want the end of suffering or we want those toys and for some of you who have the old accumulation your treasure in the past it won't be problem problems but if you don't have it you need to a lot of effort to accumulate you need to choose whether you really want to end the suffering or you want to enjoy the toys I I myself have to decide that and I decided to end the suffering I'm not ending suffering now but I have made some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3198.72,Speaker
progress but I I I am resoled to end the suffering in this direction the mind will be strong to fight in this direction in this part that I chose I want to tell you I'm not good at at talk like this when I need to talk like the master the teachers taught already a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3244.56,Speaker
lot talk so I only come here and talk about my experience to exchange experience with you some experi like some people want to sit and and Achieve calm want your mind to calm down even though it's against the nature of the mind if you end up with with focusing holding you try to keep the Mind here and if the mind don't go anywhere and you you keep it successfully you get the wrong idea the wrong will that you can control the mind,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3290.76,Speaker
the mind is controllable that's against the Buddha is teaching that the mind is not self uncontrollable in the past I I told myself teach taught myself that I try to try to tell myself the mind is uncontrollable whenever I wanted to control the mind it you be reminded of this that the mind is uncontrollable and another teaching is that whenever I practice I will have the feeling that we need to achieve something to make something up that is this need this one to to make up something try to make,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3337.64,Speaker
something go away want things to go away like the busy mind the scattering my to go away we want to achieve something like calmness that's that's the great behind your practice and the great for for something to go away like the the sadness the the bad phenomena one those thing to to go away so something to something to go away but in fact that's what one master said that you there's no need to make something,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3385.48,Speaker
arise and you know needs to make something fall away our duty is to know to know them know that once a version arises be wanting to Fall Away know that you're wanting but if there's no uh reasons to fall away that won't be follow be following away so we try to be aware of it as it really is actually the only actions that we do in Dharma practice is to know no matter what happens we just try to be aware of it that's why it's so easy because there's no need to take action we just know but before easy it might it must be difficult first but up to one point once,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3431.88,Speaker
the myness Rises without intention then it will start to comes to process of easy practice uh if you're not doing bizarre things again you will see that sometime um something arises and mindness kicks in once the automatic mindfulness arises then you can make progress into towards the rep practice which wisdom cultivation this is what we've been listening to quite often but you need the automatic mindness first the automatic mindness is the ones that comprise with the momentary the stable the mind will be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3478.44,Speaker
stable and obser all the phenomena that arises will be the ones that de knows once it when it is known or observed it is it can't be us because there's a no mind and the object they are separated that's why said that the the agregates are separated so this is in the process of D of wisdom cultivation we keep on accumulating it keep OB serving them till up to one point then the mind will understand on its own and will accept that whatever happens will fall away they are not under our Command this is the initial stage of drama that we need to reach this is a f goal um so let me talk back,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3525.96,Speaker
to the first time that I used to do things wrong I try to fight against the aversion but actually is out of my league it's exhausting and waste of time and exhausted the M get exhausted and the mindness cannot arise why it is out of my leak because we can let go of div verion as once you are non returner our duty is just know not just trying to let go of it that's not that's out of our league just know no be aware of these phenomena in fact for the angry nature,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3572.04,Speaker
person people uh as I talked to a lot of people who are angry nature some people can accept it because the thing said a verion isn't good so we try to ignore it so so try observe yourself as you really are then D practice won't be so difficult so that's all let's talk to some of the people who submit questions and then I will talk more about Dr practice some sometimes is there there are no um issues number one please I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3617.04,Speaker
have been learning lus teaching for 6 months and have not attended any courses in formal practice I do sitting meditation on a shair and observe the breaths for one hour sometimes I focus on tip of head for ahead and parts of the body experiencing pain I do walking meditation for half an hour hour observing the movement of my left and right leg in daily life I observe bodily movements my question is as I'm have chronic neck pain while I'm doing sitting meditation the pain is disturbing me sometimes I even feel breathless how should I do to improve my meditation practice please kindly guide,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3665.72,Speaker
me fore speee in fact when there's a any phenomena,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3714.84,Speaker
like the pain and ache like this first of all you need to get go to see doctor but actually like neck pain there's a also the back invo back pain invo I used to be just like this and actually the consequence of dharm practice because I do a lot of sitting meditations and it becomes stressful so the muscle in the areas of neck and back are also stressed stressful therefore these muscle becomes Tangled and the blood cannot flow towards the brain so my brain would be um busy and also painful an ache have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3760.44,Speaker
headache as well so I go to see doctors if you don't cannot is so painful that you cann't do sitting meditation or you can see you can see you can separate between the um pain and the mind as and have the Observer you need if you can do that I would suggest that you have to use the body in order to practice Dharma on and on therefore go see doctor and try to treat it for me I went to go to massage and I also do the needle acupuncture as well um and I can do citation but one if pain,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3806.96,Speaker
is so to the last extent and my smarty is not enough then I could then you should do walking meditation instead and you have to go to see doctor as well but for some people who's in a working working um there's another kind of um disorder which is office syndrome which comes from the way you're sitting for long period of time doing computer then the muscle hasn't moved to toe then it happens to your neck and pain the the shoulder pain and also back pain,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3852.72,Speaker
and it will be dizzy as well so you need to go to see doctor at the same time and you'll practice them as well use the method to practice uh that suitable for your health for example if you you said that you observe the body walking in daily life so we just observe the body there's a exist of the body not just observe to any specific part of the body if you do if you focus on each part of the body like head like feet just be aware that the Mind sing into those part of the body,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3898.68,Speaker
which is the object that the Mind know for example if you and knowing the feet the mind will sing into the feet actually body observation is just know the existence of the Body for example now body sitting be aware that the body is sitting if the body is walking knows that there is a body walking we not focus on any particular part of the body but if your tend to over Focus or sing into each part of body like the feet that feet try to be aware of them but actually knowing the existence of the body will be moment it just happens and wonder off and and knowing the pure of the body as well it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3945.76,Speaker
will be a lot lighter it would be a lot lighter than focusing on the feet or on the head it would be a lot more relaxing and comfort could you see that now the body is this sitting could you see that see when it's very easy when the body moves hand moving just know that the body moves it's a lot easier than you think actually to know people tend to forget the existence of the body we wonder of the things to see to feel and we forgot about the body sitting the body existence of the body we just come back to be aware of the body that is sitting or walking for example during walking meditation we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,3992.44,Speaker
just knew that there is a body that is walking then once the Mind Wonder off the things of things then come back to the body that is walking talking but if your mind tends to overing then just be aware for another step that now the mind is over cussing on the feet and that's all what should you do and and if you if you there's a lot of pain that might become the body is so stressful and that's compression if the body is stressful the body you you need to go to see doctors if the body is stressful the D practice wouldn't be able to relax the muscle except for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4037.6,Speaker
people who have special abilities to um to do she flowing but for the muscles that are stressful that is tight there will be an area where it's pain then you need to once they have the pain in the back you can push it down there will be uh the feeling of the stress your back it's a body stress once the once the uh vessels the blood vessels flowing towards the muscles,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4083.84,Speaker
[Music] and then block it and That Couldn't flow towards the brain then it makes the brain become dizzy and you need to go to see doctor for this cause for this case but if you cann't see sitting down meditation you can walk you have is that answering your [Music] question thank you Aang uh can I uh may know while I'm doing meditation sometime I have a set thought or a set incident that arises how should I handle it what what it what thought a sad thought sad thought okay yeah a set incident that arises how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4129.12,Speaker
should I manage it okay my what know that might wonder of to think the mind will wonderand off to things of that sad story and it will make the Mind become sad just be aware that the Mind Wonder off to think if you couldn't see that knows that the mind was dominated by the sad knows that the mind is sad know the mind as it really is and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4177.52,Speaker
keep on serving it once you know it then you can come back to your object of meditation and then it will go back go off to think of that sadness again and the sadness will come sad story again and the sadness will arise but sometime there will be some stories that come in in and makes out my sad as a background that s is s is the consequence because your mind has naturally to become sad we have to be aware of it we cannot control it to fade away or go away our duty is to be aware of it only you don't like it do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4224.8,Speaker
you you don't like it do you that is sad oh yes the sad incidence it affect interfere my meditations just know that it is sad the the present the present incident is that the sad the present moment is that the sad that comes for the mind to see the mind is not equanimous the mind is not neutral it dislikes so it's struggling to try to make it disappear therefore the present things that you need to be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4272.0,Speaker
aware is that the mind that have the disliking disliking the sadness and for some people who like to become sad very often sad very often and they are have uh they tend to be sad very easily for those people you need to be aware and then you'll see that sometime the mind is sad sometime it's not sad but the problem is you dislike it the problem is not the sadness is the disliking because this disliking is in the present you don't want it the disliking try to push it away and the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4317.48,Speaker
mind will comes to be around with that disliking and it get attached to that disliking and it won't fit it won't go away so try to be aware of the mind that is disliking the mind is not neutral you see different phenomena and you dislike it a lot of people uh just like this be like this just trying to be aware that my dislikes you don't want it right I have been learning lumus teachings for over two years and have previously attended courses in former practice I do walking meditation observing bodily movements and observing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4364.28,Speaker
mind in daily life I observe the movement and Stillness of the body my question is during walking meditation my mind remains relaxed in it home base without any over Focus control or suppression however it lacks agility and feels as it remains in a resting state of meditation there's a sadle tendency to create existence power in the practice and my mindfulness seems slow as a result the development of the wisdom is limited can aan please guide me on my practice thank,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4411.2,Speaker
[Music] you fore actually just trying to see that the my uh you you could see that the Mind stuck in the the realm of dhma practice the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4457.85,Speaker
existence of dhama practice practitioners that's very normal just trying to be aware of what that that it happened whenever you go anywhere you don't have that but once whenever you try when you start practicing then there will be a feelings that happens which is the you are practicing that's why you're stuck in that real or assistant of the Dharma practitioners so when you're stuck in that R and that existence then you will go to that kind of existence to to to that real um if the Mind stuck into the SM that you said and whenever you have the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4504.68,Speaker
pure of dhama practices is not only the physical form but also in a physical physical look but it's all you try to maintain the you try to hold on to the awareness to you become accustom to creating that once you go outside to to spend your daily life it comes it comes like that as well so trying to be aware try to be aware and try to see when you'll forget about dhama practice and trying to see what the mind is like when the mind is is natural it will be different if you could see the differences then you it wasn't much of the worry so it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4553.52,Speaker
wouldn't be so much difficult because there would be difference between these two M actually a lot of people suck into different uh realm of existence but for the real of existence that we are familiar with whenever it enters to that real again we'll be easily be aware of it when you in your daily life do you feel how what was the might like could you see that could you feel that good and when you practice is it different from that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4601.4,Speaker
[Music] because I see the differences so I know that my practice isn't natural enough actually you don't have to do anything I just know knows that now you are in the realm of existence of dama practitioners this is very normal for dhma practitioners just trying to be aware of these that this is the my of dama practitioners if you could be aware of it from time to time then you'll be relaxed more but if you can realize that you'll be stuck in that realm for a long period of time therefore when you know that the might is not Swift once you get out of the real of the existent of Dharma practitioners,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4654.29,Speaker
that kind of mind will be replicated to be still more than usual so try to be aware and notice that that it happens if you could see that if you know that you're stuck in that you will feel the difference between these minds and we [Music] when no my Ares that's kind of mind is the mind that is has the quality of being Swift as you want it and if you don't achieve that kind of mind yet do not try,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4701.4,Speaker
to striving for it if you practice correctly then it will happen on in fact if you do walking meditations you can see the body walking in a com in a relaxing way you could do that as your home base but trying to notice that while walking meditation you see that while walking is one thing and while going shopping walking in a shopping mall is another thing it's different this is the different mode when you do when you practice and when you're spending in your daily life just trying to be aware of these then you'll start to be able to get out of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4746.96,Speaker
that but then then you will be stuck in other realm of exist again for example if you are have the aversion anger you stuck you will be in the r of demon um demons then if any contact happens the my will move toward different Realms it's very normal it happens to everyone do not try to get rid of just trying to be aware of them [Music],https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4792.72,Speaker
[Music] she said my mind wasn't Swift my mind doesn't like to go to think of other things so I think myness happens very rarely and I can the m canot the mindness cannot recognize the phenomena said that you need to train practice consistently so our duty is to to calculate the cost by doing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4849.54,Speaker
formation if the causes is sufficient then the result or effect will arise on its own we cannot control the result if you want the mindness to happen very often then you cannot you cannot make it to happen it will happen whenever the causes are sufficient we have by training till we could recognize the phenomena from time to time up to one point when the mind can could recognize the phenomena the mindness will happen on its own now not according to your will yet because you want a lot myness happens very often just be aware that you want,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4894.96,Speaker
it to be happen very frequent we can't do anything else but cultivating the causes by cultivating mindness in daily life as well people who very competent to be aware of the body walking is who will be able to use it in daily life like walking to walking to the toilet um to here and there and they be aware of the body that is walking know the existence of the body that is sitting walking lying down standing um this is when you get some more points few more points if you can Cate the you pay attention to the body doing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4941.6,Speaker
different Poes in daily life you are cultivating the causes to make it be to become fulfilled for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,4990.2,Speaker
uh for for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,5064.08,Speaker
she told she want to end suffering but she in in the for Noble Truth teach to know understand suffering but for her she can understand suffering to end suffering she can see that the might create a Persona all the time create existent all the time but she try to arous mindfulness but mindfulness can come up only a few moments but cannot uh reduce the uh and the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,5133.0,Speaker
suffering suffering will end when you achieve suffering there are many levels the way you practice when we practice the the objective is the end of suffering but suffering has different grade initially we need to understand them we don't have the duty to eradicate them the function of educate suffering is wisdom wisdom will be ended with suffer uh with wisdom uh suffering will end with wisdom from our practice we don't need to to remove,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,5179.8,Speaker
suffering that is process that steps in in R of suffering the we we practice the cause the the cause is is the practice to know to know and to see suffering in body and mind the suffering in this body we feel pain and we start with knowing the suffering and we know suffering we understand suffering by seeing this body and mind until we see this body and mind we have mindfulness and have upright stable mind neutral mind be aware like teach to be aware of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,5227.6,Speaker
body and mind with impartial and stable mind so we are on the process of developing the mindfulness to know body and mind as they are what is as they are as they are they are the three characteristics it's impermanent suffering and non self the Mind needs to be uh realize realizing this truth and see everything is impermanent suffering and unself and your wisdom will gradually develop when wisdom develop initially it will remove the definement only three first definement is the wrong whe that this body is and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,5274.6,Speaker
my is ask it will reduce the doubt the uncertainty in the practice and it will reduce the Superstition in the practice if you reduce these three definement that's the first stage of steam enterer and then you keep practicing more and more it you progress to realization that this body and mind is PE suffering when it realized this body and mind is pure suffering it will reduce it you reach another step in Enlightenment is the non- returner stage at the last stage only the mind is the problem if you need to see realize that the mind is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,5321.16,Speaker
truly suffering when it break through to this truth it will get rid of suffering by itself it's not our duty to get rid of suffering when we practice we usually want to go beyond the stage we want to rid of suffering instead we should develop in stages we start with understanding with mindfulness with develop mindfulness and mindfulness will lead you will lead you to see and practice wisdom when you practice wisdom to maturity wisdom will function will wisdom will remove remove you get rid,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,5369.16,Speaker
of uh you execute those ignorant in wisdom is not removing ignorant totally at once wisdom will let you see that whatever you attach to something you suffer so we see initially when you understand suffering it's just a lesson to learn about suffering we are not trying to get rid of suffering yet uh to to execute them not it's not that stage yet so we still suffer we still suffer to learn we are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,5417.88,Speaker
still learner even though you attend the first stage of stream enterer you still call a learner because you haven't accumulate enough wisdom so you should practice by steps first be aware of this body and mind and then you see that this body and my is impermanent suffering and nonself when you see this Truth The Suffering won't go off it it's not that stage yet just be patient keep practicing and then you will progress the step by,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,5463.44,Speaker
step for she often get deceived by defilement she don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,5512.84,Speaker
believe that five aggates and my relief release a bit she used mindfulness to to take care of this and she is not confident in her mindfulness so ask for your guidance the mindfulness when when you have definement you create mindfulness to R of the definement that intention to manage that mindfulness is not true mindfulness that happen naturally it happen true cause is that remember of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,5560.48,Speaker
phenomena it won't be effective to get rid of suffering it will be another level of suffering you suffer to create those mindfulness to read of suffering you are not you Des to R of suffering but you should be aware and know of those those definement and don't follow those definement that's already a good enough practice you have patient not to follow the definement then let it bring you to do bad thing or immoral thing so you get just be aware of definement and and aware that definement arrive is no duty of us to R of them or manage them we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,5606.4,Speaker
just be aware of them and later wisdom will help manage them gradually [Music] I have been learning glus teaching for 5 years and I have not attended any courses in formal practice I over the bre up Mantra for sitting and walking meditation in the morning I spend 30 to 45 minutes in both sitting and walking meditation followed by listening to teaching on YouTube for 30 minutes before sleep I practice sitting and walking meditation for one or two hours,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,5653.24,Speaker
in daily life I Reco while taking public transport and observe feeling on my feet my question is I think a lot during work sometime my mind will W for one or two minutes and think about work during meditation if thinking is too much I can can't meditate can aant please give me some advice,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,5700.28,Speaker
fore for in fact that's very normal when you work with a lot of thinking when you to sit and meditate you always come and think of your work that's not wrong or that you cannot practice just be aware that you go off to think it's a habit when we work there's a lot of thinking,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,5752.64,Speaker
in our work so it's obsessed with those issue those work so when we come to sit and meditate we the this uh thinking in in in rotating is still keep rotating it will interfere with your meditation your worry about the work will lead you to think think and worry and if you forget the meditation that's normal because when you work with thought of thinking before you you can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,5798.64,Speaker
calm the mind a certain level it take time so it go off to think just be aware that it go off to think just it's not important what is thinking just be aware that it go off and think that's already practiced it can think of the work it can think of the family or whatever it's the same same nature of thinking just be aware that it go off that it forget if you think you cannot meditate mean deeply you have the the the idea attitude that you want it to be calm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,5844.44,Speaker
want it to stop thinking that is not the nature the nature of the mind is to think when you are aware of the thinking that you go about creating a new habit to be aware to be uh mindful so this new habit will take time before it become a new habit to be aware if you see that the micro off thing it you remember the phenomena and be mindful easily easier next time if you sit and meditate you will imagine about sitting calmly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,5890.96,Speaker
you practice formally and imagine think calmly and you the mind go off to think you be aware of that topic you can return to see the breathing or the body breathing return to your home based object and then you go off to think about the work just be aware that you go off to work if you not go off to think about work it will go off to of other things because it's by Nature that it will go off to think now we only want to create the new habit to be aware to get out of the world of thought it's not the case that you cannot meditate you just uh interpret it that you it's hard to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,5938.4,Speaker
meditate actually the the fact that you see it go after thing that's already mean you can practice so when you practice and see it once or see it twice or see 100 time a thousand times seeing the mind go off to think eventually it will remember the characteristic of getting lost of going off Wonder off and the true mindfulness will arise because it remember the precise nature precise characteristic of go going off if it go off a lot it's not bad it's actually good if you can notice them if you can notice them one twice or many times that's already a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,5984.44,Speaker
good achievement so if you see the M go off for one minute or two minute that's that's already good because when you work it go off to think about work for hours for half an hour or or a few hours so so you need to also to practice formally to be aware of of my ourself of the body and mind so there's no problem just be aware of going off Wonder off is already good practice be aware of this is mean you practice frequently is the B is good so this the answer if you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,6029.96,Speaker
have a lot of thinking that that's normal nothing wrong we are not making the mind without thought like I did in the past that I and I failed the past because is go against the nature of the Mind any more questions I have been learning Lau teaching for over 3 years and I have previously attended courses in foral practice I do walking meditation and observe the body breathing in daily life I observe bily movement and thoughts my question is I often find my mind wondering among the six senses and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,6075.28,Speaker
emotions how can ijustice thank you for your guidance John in fact actually the mind has nature to wandering off to six,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,6120.64,Speaker
senses so our duty is to be aware of them when we have these six and Eyes Ears Nose body these things which that for the do for things to comes in we don't want to close these doors and be prisoned in the cave like that we perceive things we know things but we won't cause any more mden for mind to know every second or know every door anything that dominant in the present that is the one that we will know and most of the time the mind will wonder of to Think Through the mind for example while sitting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,6166.68,Speaker
meditation we normally sitting in a peaceful place or in a quiet place like in the in the room alone nobody make contact with us therefore through the eyes and through the ears that will the taste that we because we don't through the tongue because we don't taste anything we don't eat anything there might be some smells through the nose Whenever there are their contacts making through the six it will make contact with the mind as well and we see the phenomena that arises from our hearts like when we're sitting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,6212.52,Speaker
meditation and most of the time we will wand off to think through the mind we thinking we go off to things sometime good sometime bad that depends but initially when we cannot be aware of the mind that goes off the things the behavior of the mind that Wonder off to things through the mind if we can't know that sometime it fabricates stories like good stories and we become relaxed but for then bad story we feel dissatisfied just trying to know these feelings through the Mind through your heart but if you could do the If You observe the behavior of the mind which is to wander away which is very normal it goes off the things and it happens all day long whatever we do we have to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,6259.12,Speaker
think this is when we the my working all the time and most of the time it l and thought our duty is to be aware that my L and thought the be the mind that is being lost is very natural is very common to everyone that for example when you listen listen to me talking you already your mind is already lost like in this morning you hear the bird chirping and that's when we hear the sound through our ears when you see hear the sound and and there's nothing happens but once the feelings uh Rising through your heart it make contact with your heart then you feel that oh that's not a good sound and it becomes irrit very irritating but is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,6306.52,Speaker
a is a very good and and beautiful bird sharping and try to be aware of your heart so it's very normal for the m to wonderand through the six have you heard have you read in the typa in the text that like among I used to listen but I but the point is like the are novice that's very there's there was a mon very good he's an expert he want to learn dama practice from other Masters but nobody want to teach him and there was a and there was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,6353.32,Speaker
a um a nest and there are six holes in the nest in this nest of an animal and you want to cash that wandering away so you try to shut down all other do and only let one doors open in order to be aware of it so but in daily life we wonder away through six C but if you try to forbid it to happen to wanding away through six there will be burden cost through the mind and we won't be able a to be aware of it and you won't be able to truly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,6400.12,Speaker
aware of the phenomena therefore while sitting meditation if you try to close all the doors like all the five doors and let only one door through the Mind work Once the mind W off you'll be aware of it very easily so when you try to train yourself to be aware of the phenomena through thinking through the mind the it's phenomena the phenomena itself which is the wondering away is actually the same thing whether it's Wonder of to hear to see to smell to think they're all the same if you understand one wondering way which is like an great example for other kinds of wondering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,6445.72,Speaker
mind is the is the common characteristics of the wondering my through other six and once it wand off to different draws then then it will be the same if it has the behavior of the of the mind to goes off if you can't be aware of it then and there will be feelings arisings within your heart whether it satisfaction disatisfaction there will happen through your heart so try to aware of these feelings know it as they really know them as they really are so when the contact makings there will there might,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,6495.16,Speaker
be weers and there will be reactions from those contact making but if you quick enough and you keep training and once it wand off if you could recognize it it's like you lost in the world of thought all of a sudden you just knew that you don't have to care what story of the mind is whether it's good or bad but the thing that you need to be aware is that behavior of the Mind the character of the mind that it's wandering away the characteristic of wandering away if you could see this then after a while keep on observing these characteristics when it happens again the mind will know the mind will be awakened that's when the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,6541.72,Speaker
mindfulness takes place that's the mindness that that's that which happens without Our intention for it to happen it happens on its own when the mind can remembers the phenomena firmly at that moment once you become awakened and self aware the mind that is s aware is the mind that is wholesome the mindfulness is wholesome the delusion or wandering away is another kind of definement which is delusion which will fall away all atically because the definement and the wholesomeness and UNH cannot arise together and the mind can only know one thing at a time because the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,6587.72,Speaker
once the mindness arises with the mind then the delusion or wandering away will fall away once the myness kicks in and wondering away go fall away then the will arise together with the m that's the momentary that time that at that time this might the mind would be stable that just now just gone the wondering away just gone and the thought just and gone is gone there will be no there will be only thinking but not the fs M with it attached to it that's when the nor my arises and the optic just gone and if you have enough you could see that it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,6635.12,Speaker
falls away but once happen sometimes it's too quick you couldn't see it but it already happened no matter uh it doesn't matter whether you could see it or not that's initial State while practicing when you are not quick enough that's okay you keep on training practicing you keep observing you keep on observing it then the mindness SM will become stronger back then when I was practicing initially and I become so aware and have the mindfulness I could feel it I could feel it but sometime sometimes I could see it sometime I couldn't see it and I was wondering if why I couldn't see it but the thing is I get to accumulate the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,6680.84,Speaker
my you would see when your SM and my is enough for example aversion arises the myness can recognize the aversion mindness will rise on it own and it give rise to SMY as well once the SM is stronger and strong and it's enough it could see that the aversion Fall Away sometime you just see it instantly for example wandering away just Falls away and that myness falls away as well because you don't have enough smarty sometime you can see that you couldn't see it but actually I used to ask L that why I couldn't see that L said that he said it's okay the mind's already in it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,6726.52,Speaker
you don't you didn't see it in fact in theory when we don't that the might is not us there's no self and the might is not our the mind is not at that moment we didn't know but if the mind could see it it keep on see on observing it we keep on training it it was gradually gaining the Right View right understanding that the Mind Aris in the far way mindness as well it rise arises in the far way you you understand that there's no self there's just things that arise and Fall Away on and on I'm not sure whether this answering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,6773.2,Speaker
your [Music] question e [Music],https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,6819.92,Speaker
I have another questions about walking Med recently when I was walking meditation I felt as my mind is relaxed but while medit walking meditation if feel like floating like floating in the air like light I'm not sure whether my mind was wanding towards the Comfort relaxation or it's natural I'm not do you feel that the mind is natural as they normally are that it is normally is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,6889.76,Speaker
I felt it's relaxed it's relaxing but while walking meditation I don't have this kind of comfort that much but now walking meditation I felt it is natural and I can walk so so long and not get tired easily and as said that while walking do you feel the existence of the body walking,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,6954.32,Speaker
I could do that when I feel relaxed the body feel light say that while walking if you're not overing if you not hold on to awareness but you could feel the body that is walking then you could feel that the body is walking the system the body walking then it is that it is acceptable the walking Med is fine but if you think that it is too light just know it as it really is just know that this is light and there's a doubt and certainty that why is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,7001.92,Speaker
light some people varies from one person to another person for example if your mind stuck in the realm of dma practitioners then the intention towards holding the awareness will make the Mind heavy but if could just if you could see that the body that is you could see the exist the body walking in a relaxing way your mind will be lighter than when you hold on to the awareness but if it it's too light then if it's too light so that you could couldn't see the phenomena you couldn't see the phenomena,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,7047.76,Speaker
of knowing the body and wandering away that's when the delusion comes you have you try to notice it if you if if it's like it means that you don't overusing overing make your heart heavy like this cup if it says it's not heavy when whenever you hold on to it it's heavy it's like if you just know the body that is walking and the body is different thing you see it but you don't carry it then there would be no heaviness but once you attach to the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,7093.96,Speaker
body hold on awareness to the body it's like you carry a cup that would be a heaviness you try to notice this point if whether while walking you but sometime it's too light from my experience sometimes it's too light because you don't pay attention to anything if you could feel feel the existent of the body or sometime the might are wandering away [Music],https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,7140.68,Speaker
that's fore,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,7191.04,Speaker
[Music] I have an questions about walking related to walking meditation this morning when I was walking there were a few moments when I felt the contact making of the foot on the ground and there are different moments that I felt that those the feelings gone just there are different moments there are a number of moments like that I'm not sure whether that's correct or not in fact whatever happen just know it as it really is that it happens like,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,7244.07,Speaker
that then it changes to different thing just know it as it really is whether it's correct or not is it's m of what thought because you kept uh circling in your thought that whether it's right or wrong it will be correct if your know that you uh uncertain or have questions sometimes you think that while walking at is to floating like a so light in a Fe Fe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,7291.36,Speaker
feather sometime it's like the vision and you having the vision and you think that you're like an on the clouds just be aware of it and then come back to the body come back to the body the true the the physical body walking actually because they are form there are weight that you could feel sometimes they are like floating on the air like it's a vision it's actually a vision you could you feel that you felt that like you could fly it doesn't happen to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,7337.04,Speaker
everybody but it's possible it's a vision just be aware of it for thank,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,7384.12,Speaker
youan a few days ago I felt I've learned so many things and I have more understanding and less questioning thank you very [Music] [Music] much um let's just have some break and then we'll continue again and on and then we come back,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d9JcyeUj1U,7429.2,Speaker
in the [Music] morning listen to the d of do you understand the principle of Dharma practice this is the outline the concept Dharma practice for D practitioners if they don't they don't comply with the outline of the Dharma practice they wouldn't be able to succeed the principle of Dharma practice is to be self aware and our duty is to [Music] um ignore and to get rid of the cause of the suff suffering we don't aim to know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5.4,Speaker
the suffering it is actually to see the suffering as it it really is what is the truth of the um the aggregate or the physical or mental part it is that these things are subjected to three characteristic they changes H they change and they move they keep on arising and falling constantly cannot be maintained in one particular form and is not under our control is not according to our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,55.08,Speaker
desire all the things arises from its cause and its contributory factors not according to our desire or our will in order to understand these truths we need to have the S aware or the mindfulness to be awakened be awakened from the world of thoughts and dreams awaken from the world of thoughts and [Music] fabrications become the Noah awaken and the knowah,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,104.56,Speaker
The Seer not a thinker rator or an actor the most important the most tough the toughest part of Dharma practice is this point almost almost the practitioners um they aim to act to fabricate take action did not familiarize themselves with seeing things as they really are if they don't aim to see but to do or take,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,150.48,Speaker
action then it's incorrect according to the duty vulnerable truth because our duty to vulnerable truth is to see to know to know actually is to see it is not like we want to um fix things or try to adjust the five arus according to our will or according to our desire so you need to know your heart whether while practicing you aim to all the phenomena actually are do you have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,198.36,Speaker
the qu do you have the finalization to uh see as there are or to try to fix the aggregate TR to adjust the aggregate when it's suffering you aim to get rid of it try to make it happy if the and wholesomeness arises you try you aim to fix it to get rid of the wholesomeness according to our will so try to evaluate yourself try to evaluate your behavior of the Mind whether you tend to know the suffering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,245.48,Speaker
and get of the cause of suffering or you tend to fabricate fix adjust change the five aggregate which is actually not under our control however we're still not knowing the vulnerable truth with Crystal Clarity we don't know the duty towards the suffering therefore we aim to do the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,291.4,Speaker
possibilities trying to fix or adjust things you can do that actually but it's only for temporal if anyone's want to try and fix a shame things for a period of time till you become familiarized with it then you tend to have the inclinations to have have the misunderstanding to develop the misunderstanding like the like uh in order to develop the Right View you need to have the right concept to walk the path to see that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,337.24,Speaker
everything subject to change and everything is nonself if anyone tries to adjust chains take action do things till they become um accustomed to it they will be they will have develop the inclination TOS creating wrong view within their heart because when you're doing things fix things as usual um as often as you can and you think that you can actually fix thing change change or adjust the phenomena,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,383.72,Speaker
within our hearts in fact we can't actually do that we can only do forong a short period of time temporarily you need to have this understanding our duty towards our desires needs to be eradicated we tend to do we do we have a tendency to know the desire as it is and try to eradicate it or or our all these desires take control our minds and make,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,431.56,Speaker
us think do things like do good thing bad things or practice them or try to fix things change yourself adjust yourself or other people try to evaluate yourself whether most of us most of the time the heart aim to know uing and eradicate the cause of suffering or not from my experience normally the tradition that don't have the progress they do wrong according to the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,479.6,Speaker
duty towards the for no truth they tend to fix changing in order to develop um good phenomena for example their mind is scattered to try to fix that phenomena to make it better to make it calm if the Mind developed the censal pressure then they um they try to fix it or if they develop the anger they try to uh develop the um meta instead so these things are method to uh fix change or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,524.64,Speaker
fabricate the uh the aggregate the ultimate goal for these action is practice or Comm you need to understand this practice or Comm is the practice for the purpose of to make the mind that is bad to become good to make the mind that is exhausted to become energized to make the sad mind to become happy mind make the mind that is scattered to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,573.32,Speaker
become calm do you understand this concept this is to fix to change all the bad things the ultimate result for this practice is to gain the satisfactions of having the good heart good mind happy mind or calmness or relaxation it seems like there no definement that in fact all these kind of good phenomena happens because of the as a result of fixing things taking action adjusting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,620.12,Speaker
things and do something or fabricating things so very important concept here is that whenever you're trying to fix things change the phenomena that happens within your heart you are for example you're are being sad but you're trying to be Blossom sometime you are suffering you're trying to make it happy or you become scattered you're trying to make it calm these kind of process is the heart of smar practice make bad things to become good make bad mind to become good mind you make the mind that's back to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,669.4,Speaker
defs and make it disappear according to your desire this is not knowing the suffering it actually has some benefit because it makes your mind happy and relaxed and calm and Blossom and energized [Music] to live happily in the world or to survive compete with other people the world or do a lot of things in the world and it's also the strength of the mind enough,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,716.28,Speaker
to support wisdom cation or know know the suff if your mind is not energized at all you cannot know the suffering you need to understand this concept very important to know the suffering but in order to know the suffering you need to have the tool in order to know the suffering which is that the Mind needs to have some strength and happiness and calmness to some extent so why at first I said that that's not knowing to knowing the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,761.44,Speaker
suffering actually that's not kn during the suffering it's actually the Fabrications of the mind to make the mind to become strong to develop strength and as a uh and as a supporting uh to know the know the suffering you actually need to do this but you need to have this understanding uh what's the purpose of each action what's the purpose of each practice so smart practice is re ired SM practice cannot be done solely you need to know the suffering as well which is to develop the wisdom,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,807.04,Speaker
practice practice is to Cate wisdom wisdom cation requires m m can be categorized into two two categories the first one is wrong smart and the second one is the right SMI the wrong is the that is not comprised with mindfulness right M sorry right SM can be categorized in other two categories the first one is to make the my rest and gain some strength and gain calmness um and strength and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,856.08,Speaker
happiness the second kind of right which is even more important than uh Comm which is when the Mind need to be stable the mind that is stable is very difficult to understand because people tend to think of smart as wrong kind of SM or doing SMY as a calm for for the purpose of calmness make the might good calm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,906.04,Speaker
[Music] strong a lot of practitioners when their might becomes calm and strong they think that that's enough but actually that's not enough because you don't start doing your duty towards the vulnerable TR therefore once your mind devel of calmness and calmness and strength you need another step to develop yourself to develop the mind to be stable the stable mind is the mind is is not uh sending towards something sending out the while seeing phenomena the mind is not sending out or singing in the object,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,951.68,Speaker
not singing in the phenomena other people in the world when who don't have the stable mind once whenever they see phenomena the mind be sent out to see those phenomenas or singing those phenomena or the objects that the Mind knows so for example can you see the flowers here there's a lot of colors variance of colors here the white flowers pink ones and there also small Petals of small leaves of the flowers a lot of people m flowing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1001.92,Speaker
towards the flowers can you see that this is the m that is sending out and flowing thinging in into the objects just now when the I pay ATT pay attention to the flowers and you imagine that you're not being self aware you're sitting here the body is here but the mind doesn't aware isn't aware of the body that is this is when the mind is not stable whenever you see things you sending out to see things when you listen to things your might sending out to listen to things,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1049.16,Speaker
when you think you sing into the world of thought whenever you see any kind of phenomena with this happiness and happiness greed aversion illusion a lot of people feel that all these phenomenon emerging in within your heart within the middle of your chest and people tend to for example this is the mind this is the object create aversion Illusions Happiness and happiness the minds tend to attach thing into that out to those phenomena this is when you see phenomena you know that you are angry you know that you might developed heat or lust or aversion but the Mind sing into those phenomena the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1094.28,Speaker
Mind adhere to the phenomena or the objects that the Mind knows this is the phenomena that the mind that hasn't developed the SM or the mind that is not stable so now let's try everyone now sitting and you just trying to be aware try to sense existence of the body anyone can see that the my flows within the body sing into the body can please raise your hand if you can see that nobody no at all very,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1141.44,Speaker
fascinating do you understand what I'm saying or you don't understand anyone that can follow up please uh knot your head if you understand what I'm saying thank you very much can can you notice that when you when I said thank you very much and a lot of people have some happiness arising within your heart the might becomes broaden and relaxed your are submer into the happiness but when you're sitting you don't know that your body is sitting did you follow up yeah can you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1187.56,Speaker
follow what just happened now the mind just lost for a moment except for people who can see the mental phenomenas very frequently and they could see that they might become relaxed they might become happy if they could see that then they are not lost but anyone that lost at completely don't see the body sitting or the my what's like the Mind pression that those those people are lost actually people in the world or animals in the world just like that whenever the uh the sors make contact with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1234.04,Speaker
world see things listen to things they tend to pay attention to those ensal objects and forget about thems at that moment they don't have the self awareness what bodies like they never know what's the mind like they never know is that happen to you often or you don't have that at all or you trying to lie that you're not having it at actually it happens to everyone even I have this kind of this what happen but my mindfulness,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1279.2,Speaker
is quicker than you guys when whenever my mind flow towards the flowers I used to practice the mind that sending out to the object so Once the mind sending out I'll become I become awakened Once the mind knows that the my out my mind is awaken so the heart of Mind of the is that competent knowing the mental phenomena whenever it flows towards the six sent doors when the I sending out to see to feel to make contact with the world heat sof Nets vibrations of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1327.04,Speaker
body or feel the not heart this this is when the master said to make it easy to um is not to send the mind out when the Mind moves towards the flowers this is when the mind sending out but when they said do not send aite out it's not try it's it's not like when you're trying to control the mind not to sending out not do not send the M Out means that whenever the Mind goes towards or sending,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1374.96,Speaker
out be mindful of that phenomena be mindful of the mind sending out so when I said the mindful of that phenomena it's quite a bit confusing as well because when I said be mindful you need to means that you need to practice to the mindfulness can recognize the phenomen of the my sending out it's not like when we have the uh intention to control the my to maintain that thing to make it happen so if you have the intentions to do so the right mindfulness won't happen when the mindfulness happens it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1419.96,Speaker
will happen without tensions but mindfulness cannot happen on its own we need to know the proximate cause of the mindfulness the proximate cause of the mindfulness is when the mind can recognize the phenomena firmly it need to you need to see the phenomena as often as as much as they need till they can recognize the phenomena whenever that phenomena arises without intentions to see or to know or to feel or don't have any intentions to have the mindness at all the mindness will automatically knows that the mind sending out can you follow me do you follow,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1467.0,Speaker
me therefore mindfulness cannot be command to happened whenever you command the myness to arise or you have intention to see the mind of sing out that's not the right mindfulness yet but in the process of practice you need that intention you need to have the heatness the the heat fness to be aware of the phenomena the mind sending out is one example of the phenomena that can happen this what L tried to communicate that um in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1517.28,Speaker
order to practice D correctly you need to be able to see the phenomena phenomena can be categorized in both uh physical and mental phenomena it depends on each person practice whether they are competent at knowing mental or physical parts it depends on each individual at first when I said I I talked about the concept of D everything is to change and not under command these are the truth it is it is applied to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1563.28,Speaker
everyone everyone needs to be able to see from this perspective from the perspective of three characteristics this is is the truth everyone needs this our duty is to know the suffering and get rid of the cause of suffering this apply to all but up to the point when you do the SMART practice in order to make the Mind calm happy Blossom it will be red according to individual cu the D that can be used um is different from what from one person to another person,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1609.36,Speaker
therefore the method in order to achieve the C to make the might calm happy and Bloss is numerous it's countless the countless method to make the mind uh to be calm and make the mind change from suffering to happiness to from scatter to harness to exhaustion from exhaustion to energized so there are various kind of methods to practice kindless M which can be categorized into 40 categories this is mainly an outline is only an outly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1657.24,Speaker
for C Mar but in fact any objects are applied both mental physical objects can be anything and any object of meditations SP can can only allow you your mind to become energized and calm so this is different from person to another person everyone has different likewise to know the phenomena each person un competent knowing the phenomena uh differently one person might like to know the Phenom the mental phenomena,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1705.24,Speaker
other people might want to do to know physical phenomena it depends on each demin we can just try to practice together just for a moment like a lot of people try to get ready for dber practice a lot of people like almost everyone moving like this in here and that they try to get ready for practice when you moving is is there anyone who could see that they moving can please raise your hand if you see that you're moving you know you're sensing that you're moving it's half of the room can see can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1750.84,Speaker
see that who are these people these are the people who used to observe the physical parts to observe the body that it moves like when the body moves their no so they sense that or moving their hands 14 Tes 14 Dynamic meditation they used to do that um this is when they know the body moving and stopping moving like this move and cease move and stop move and stop once move and then it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1798.8,Speaker
stops therefore the physical part the physical part could be uh the body lying sitting down walking line standing still or the body moving and staying still the body breathing in the body breathing out keep on practicing to try to observe the phenomena when I'm saying observing the phenomena I means that you sense the phenomena do not pay attention to the phenomena do not look at the phenomena when you feel it for example the air within this room is it hot or cold hot or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1850.08,Speaker
cold if cold please knot your head oh if you feel that there's coret in this room you need to send the M out to feel the coret you only you can feel it instantly with mind it's natural mind when you're sitting here can you feel that the person uh that next to you there's a person next to you can you feel that could you feel that the PO people there are people in this room there are people in front of you people in the back of you you're surrounded by people this is the feelings the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1896.84,Speaker
sensing when you feel it when you sense it it's not like when you're looking at it if you're looking at it or focusing on it or singing in you will feel that the person next to you is wearing orange Shir or the women or men shot along hair you will notice can you differentiate between sensing and looking can you be would you be able to differentiate um like so the mind that s sensing or feeling the mind will be relaxed and comfortable and natural it's not the mind that is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1942.32,Speaker
greedy or craving for seeing things when you craving for seeing things your mind will tend to sending out or singing to the objects that it see do you understand what I'm saying can you follow therefore feel it sense it not focusing not looking at it feel it sense it not having is not having attention pay not paying attention to it but in the process of practicing you requires a little bit of intention if you have no intention at all you won't be able to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,1987.92,Speaker
feel it but if you have a lot of intention too greedy then you become um focused and the result of the focus is that the mind will sing into the objects that the Mind knows at the moments that the Mind sing into the phenomena that the Mind knows at that moment you're not become self-aware the body what body is like you never know what's the mind like you'll never know the the awareness will be with the objects outside you can you feel that can you follow me um so when I say,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2033.36,Speaker
sensing feeling is not focusing can you moving head like this sensing The Heading the head moving when you're if that weaing happens or moving movement happen this phenomena doesn't tell whether it is women men or what age you can sense the movement through the heart you just feel that something something just move this is the phenomenon that that happened in nature this is not the person is not animals this not he or she or what is the name what how old is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2079.32,Speaker
it or coming from what country but if females or males or age happens that require thinking if you start thinking there will be men women children old people smart people beautiful people not beautiful people do you understand that's the phenomena actually when you could see the phenomena when you feel the phenomena as nature you won't be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2127.24,Speaker
able you won't feel the um the label the labeling there will be no names do you understand a lot of people nodding their heads while nodding their heads there will be a feelings of something moving just something that moving that the weight is different that's it a lot of people's mind know how to feel how to sense can you feel that the body is sitting there only an object just sitting here if you can sense with the correct mind there will be no person animals no,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2174.2,Speaker
labeling as women men mon or just only an object sitting if you have a a little bit more intention to sense it your mind will be submerged within the body sitting Once the mind sing in the body sitting the mind will develop some weight they will develop some um tightness within their heart the mind some of some people will be stiff it's not broaden it's not relaxed it's not light do you follow me can you feel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2222.96,Speaker
it therefore feel it do not focusing sense it do not looking at it but in the process of practice it requires a little bit of intention there is some attention or intention until that you'll be able to recognize that phenomena this is not the intention of tension I'm I'm thirsted I want to reach out to the glass of water if I my my drift to see if my if I practice the body moves and I can recognize the body movement and I have intention it then will be awakened on his own this is when the right mindfulness happens do you follow,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2269.6,Speaker
me so when you practice we practice from the people who hasn't have the mess till we can develop develop the mindfulness if you have intention or attention to feel that's the right mindfulness doesn't happen but it's in the process of developing the right mindfulness is to develop the mindfulness that could see could recognize the phenomena that happened repetitively until the mind can recognize can memorize that movement if the it that movement then you'll become awaken on its own automatically the mindness arising once the right mindness arises the right smarty or the correct,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2316.6,Speaker
kind of smarty will arise together whenever the right mindness arises without intention it happens on its own because we act on its we produce we do its cause till you can recognize the phenomena and we don't have the intention to make it happen it can happen both physical mental Parts it h if the mindfulness happens without intention then the mind will become broaden and freshen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2363.2,Speaker
and become cell aware for for a moment this is when the right happens which is called momentary SM so the right SM cannot be produced according to your will that I give an example of the Mind flowing sending out to see the flowers if the mind sending out to see the flowers and I know that uh the mind sending out of flowers and right mindness will rise this is when I practice my mind till the mind can recognize the M sending out,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2409.56,Speaker
then once the M standing out without intention at all I don't have any intention at all but the M used to see this kind of phenomena this kind of behavior of the my sending out enough till it can recognize the phenomena then the right mindness the automatic right the the right mindness then automatically AR you follow now let's try you see that when you when you start practicing can you feel that you're a little bit freshen up you're refreshed a lot of people um um if you listen a lot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2459.04,Speaker
if a little bit confused but when you're moving can you make the mind uh towards your hair send the mind out send the mind out to your hair you notice that when the feelings in your head the awareness will be within your head other PE uh other parts of the body will gone this is when the phen this is when the mind sending out to hear this is the phenomenon let's try to take the feelings towards the awareness towards your left feet left foot could you feel that the might can run and move from here to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2504.4,Speaker
there to the left foot where the awareness is the mind is there because the mind has the duty to become aware can you move the awareness to the right foot Do You observe your mind sink into the right foot can you separate can you see not your head you should be able to feel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2551.32,Speaker
it the behavior like this is something that happen to us all day long our mind our change to uh form and sound and sight and feeling all places in our body shame and move to observe but we don't see we don't we are not aware even this Behavior happen all day from now on try to be a new one try to learn about yourself the method to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2597.68,Speaker
practice first you pick one meditation object You Can chant any objects physical or mental to be your home based to be an awareness object you practice so that you will see your mind will not be staying at that object for a long time your mind will shift will go out to S out it may focus on when you my over focus on that body if this is the body you will you will not be aware it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2644.24,Speaker
uh shifting moving and sinking focusing when you are chanting but after chanting for a while your mind will forget and think about other things or you might think into the chanting at that time is focusing on the chant you follow so you meditate on one object and then be aware of our mind your mind will move to some other things go off to think go off to see something or go off and sink into that sitting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2691.24,Speaker
body focusing on the Walking body focusing on the chanting do you follow then when you practice what's the objective how do you achieve the correct Sam what I say most people don't have it we PR we practice in this way is a fast method when you meditate on one object and then be aware of your mind your mind will forget and go off to think go off to hear what happened the most frequently is going off to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2736.32,Speaker
think on the other hand your mind can go and think into focusing on that object there are two sides for example if my object is here at my nose if I want to uh see it clearly I will focus my mind will sink and stay at the nose so I might will stay here Focus here after a while after I meditate on this North I see a girl very beautiful girl,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2784.16,Speaker
my dream girl my my will forget this breath and go to that my dream girl it go off to see do you follow after practicing for a while the mind will remember the moving mind the shifting mind if you it can remember and without intention when your mind go off to see then you will be aware the automatic mindfulness will arise it will see the Mind move the my,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2830.48,Speaker
run the my setting off the correct mindfulness arise then the correct concentration correct samti will arise can you follow is it hard yeah is a bit hard when teaching is not hard but when practicing is somewhat hard but not hard Beyond possibility but it's not as easy like,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2879.2,Speaker
listening and understanding and it can remember how to do it it's not as easy like that because our habit our familiarity to forget oneself Habit to lost our awareness not seeing the phenomena these habit our animal our beings have this in our lifetimes for many lifetimes in the past we have been reborn for many lifetimes this habit is in our mind we have no habits to learn and see,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2928.36,Speaker
ourself to see the phenomena of the moving mind so you need to invest your effort to practice if you practice enough and correctly to one point you will be able to remember the phenomena it's not Beyond practice but it's not very easy either you cannot just practice you need to practice for one or two days or a few hours then you can remember if you practice for a while and understand and then you forget and don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,2974.8,Speaker
keep practicing it will return to the old habit of not seeing the phenomena many of us here many of you learned for many years do you see that uh before you come to the point of seeing the my going off the my moving the my remembering phenomena it will take years of practice there's nothing free and those who uh can Enlighten fast they are have they have been practiced in the past their past life we all can choose we can choose to let I go off to think uh like our own,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3020.76,Speaker
old habit or you can is the new habit to be the knower The Awakening The Seer of all the fabrication of the moving the creating the fabrication of good and bad is can be practiced if you practice enough and correctly you will obtain the result the correct practice is just to be aware not to focus not to sink in when you practice enough practice regularly not just like 5 minute a day,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3069.96,Speaker
one day we have 24 hour 5 minutes and watch the rest 23 hour and 55 minutes they are all the old habit the energy The Habit you get from the practice is so little it will take a long time on never achieving the result so the part exist the way the teaching of explaining how to practice why to practice and what's the result they are this explanation are all clear is uh methodology is a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3117.32,Speaker
discipline it's not just a belief a Buddhist is not just asking from the Buddha image those uh asking is not about Buddhism Buddhism is a subject a discipline it had reasons it's no Superstition Superstition is the teaching about the Mind practice from the Mind become uh upright stable and have mindfulness using the cheerful mind that have been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3166.48,Speaker
practiced of restful SM that is aware of the moving mind the shifting mind it moves to to see to hear to listen move to focus on the object so we practice two way the about s to for arrest and practice to be aware for a while aware after you see that the Mind move that the might go,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3214.32,Speaker
off and then the the brightness the stability will will arise for a moment you will get the mind the Mind here is the mind is a Observer have the stability and energy and [Music] mindfulness from our practice of regular practice regular seeing and remembering these are the factors that practitioners need to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3260.76,Speaker
develop to see to know suffering to develop wisdom until you can see your own body and mind your own Aggregates as they are as the three characteristics see them moving changing cannot sustain under oppression cannot follow your desire it will not uh as be as we wish do see do you understand the process of practice take this into your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3306.16,Speaker
practice if you can practice you will develop and progress in the T in for quickly this is not a secret but it require patience because it's go against our own habit our habit of delusion forgetful for many lifetimes in our samsara you understand is is not too hard is is not difficult if it's hard no one can do it but it's also not too easy just just attending the course and you get good at it it will take effort and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3351.8,Speaker
practice what you need to learn you not you need to listen this is all I will take uh your homework from it w student number one I have been learning long po teachings for eight years and I have previously attended courses in foral practice I observe the Brave and recite during inra do during out breath in daily life I observe the bodily movements please kindly guide me in my practice is there anything that needs improvements thank you Adan you are more awake than before and there's more awareness,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3401.08,Speaker
but the mind is still not stable now the mind is immersed in the phenomena Can you feel it try to place your awareness on the body your mind is immersed inside Can you feel it your mind is starting to come up now you can feel it now right it's more relaxed now it's more relaxed than when your mind was immersed In This Moment the mind is still not stable but it's not deeply immersed anymore can you feel it once you let go and let the mind come out it's Bren more relaxed you see that the Mind drifting away,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3448.64,Speaker
easier so do not try to control the Mind within try to make the my weaing to the outside world be normal person whenever Happiness and happiness good or bad feelings arises within your minds after making contact with the world try to be mindful of this of this phenomenon your my is better now so trying to fix it and trying to be aware of the mind that fix within in Singing in this is the familiarization of the mind to be control within now you're submerged in you singing again and would you be able toate it if you can recognize this phenomena whenever it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3496.32,Speaker
within then you become awaken again because if the mind can sing it like this it mean that it has to move in you understand what I'm saying okay okay it's good it's a lot better than last time I have been learning L teachings for two years I have previously attended courses in former practice I primarily focusing on chant a Shan jundi mantra for at least one hour preceded by 20 minutes of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3541.76,Speaker
walking meditation in daily life I use recitation of jundi Mantra as my home base I find challenging to cons consistently remember this during daily activities my question is I sometime experience a flurry of thoughts during my former practice sometimes I'm unable to observe any phenomena occasionally I am aware of the phenomena and my mind gets absorbed in them however upon noticing this I unconsciously pull my mind back resulting in stiffness in daily life I often encounter moments of anger seemingly arising from nowhere I feel that I haven't fully developed wisdom am I practice correctly please kind guide,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3587.72,Speaker
me said that your your fire are separated and you tend to sometime the mindfulness is automatically arises but sometimes not sometimes the SM is Goodtime the SM is bad sometimes you would feel as if uh your practice is make makes progress but sometime your practice is and not making any progress at all this kind of process will happen to everyone to happen to all the practitioners and if anyone practice until there are greater development and it is and it makes progress every day it means that you practice,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3634.4,Speaker
incorrectly because it's def five the rules of the three characteristics because everything subject to change not under control and suffering so how is it possible if the rules of dhma is like that and how is that possible if the if your practice will will make Pro will making progress every day without deterioration so whether your mindfulness happens frequently according to your will do you understand when everything is impermanent everything arises it false way so everything subject to uh subject to sh including the result of the Dharma practice so the result of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3680.2,Speaker
the practice will be progressing and and not progressing till your mind will become equanimous towards the progressing and deter DET progressing and deteriorating if you're making progress on and on your heart will we know that at the end of the day it will deteriorating once in in deteriorating you you feel that you need to become patient enough till it become uh progressing again it's like when if it makes progress you might don't your might doesn't weather if it deteriorating your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3726.64,Speaker
might won't weather as well your duty is to be aware of the phenomena in the present moment till your mind accepts the phenomena as they really are as as as an so all kind of practice will make progressing and itating on and on all kind of Virtues that been developed at one point it will be deteriorating or even all the bad things that you fabricated at to up to one point it will Falls away it will fall away this is what I try to uh extend your knowledge which is the wisdom,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3773.72,Speaker
cultivation so whenever the determination happens just you can try and con contemplate on this contemplating give chance for the mind to have the perspective towards other things as they are under three characteristics up to one point if it competent seeing in this perspective you will develop uh the right perception the right perception if it happens whenever you see the phenomena it will start to sense the rising and falling or impermanent,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3820.52,Speaker
or deteriation or cannot sustain cannot endure or nonself it will be able to see in one of these three characteristic one of these perspective do you follow do you understand this is what I said is it to guide the Mind did development of the of the development of the wisdom in the future so why do we practitioners need to be able to see the phenomena because it is not the aim to see the phenomena first of all we see the phenomenon in order to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3866.44,Speaker
in order to develop the mindfulness once the right mindness arises then you will have the right SM but we don't observe the phenomena in order to know to recognize F but we need to see or ourself phenomena in order to see that they are subject to uh impermanent suffering in nonself they change their nonself they're not under control you can observing these kind of these three perspective and you need to be able to recognize that the mind that is that no the phenomenas are impermanent suffering and nonself even the no am I arising following way no my cannot be commanded to rise all the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3913.24,Speaker
phenomenons that the might knows are not under your control therefore both the object that the Mind knows and the mind that is know that knows arises FS away impermanence not under under control not according to your will so in order to make progress and develop the wisdom your mind need to be stable however for you your mind start to become stable but it's not to that extent so you need to be heedful of the my setting out you tend to be able to be aware of the might sending out but but there are still rooms to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,3959.68,Speaker
grow so there are only two points First Med an object of Med meditate on an object and try to be aware of the mind that Wonder off so the Mind develop stability the second one is once you see the phenomenas try to Perce perceive that those phenomena in terms of the three characteristics in whatever perspective it is for you the characteristics that might suitable for you is that all the things arise Fall Away it comes and goes it cannot be it not Endor it doesn't endure that's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,4010.64,Speaker
all number three I have been learning L teaching for seven years and have previously attended courses ined practice combine walking meditation with presentation such as Shin of buo or sudra typically I do formal practice for approximately one to two hour each day I also do morning and evening shanting during a time I activities of body and mind focusing on various mental replications my question is I feel that I understand the principle of the practice and it can served many changes in the mind sometimes my mind is prly stable allowing me to observe the works of the body in the mind however my mental strength is weak and my mindness slow I have experienced inner redness and my mind tends to be scattered can a John please guide me on how to break through in my,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,4070.92,Speaker

everyone this is very true but if I said this if I said like this it will cause burden to your heart when you practice we will determine our progress from our self our old self we won't compare ourself to other people do you like to compare yourself to other people do you like that yeah correct from now on we don't compete with other people we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,4275.48,Speaker
don't practice in order to compete or to gain something we only practice dhma in order to know ourself more to discover ourselves if you understand yourself more and more then the suffering will be lessen if you understand yourself with Crystal Clarity then that be no suffering at all I myself need to practice myself as well when the practitioners will fight that once you have the morality you can do Smarty And you cut with mindness and wisdom if you feel that you understand yourself more then the mind will become,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,4321.92,Speaker
more relaxed and and cling on to other things in a lesser extent then the suffering would be shorten the clinging towards things will be uh to less extent and the mind will be subject to suffering less and less do you feel that your suffering is uh reducing right you gain some fruit of the Dharma practice your duty is do more practice more with patience,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,4367.68,Speaker

to the Noble Truth the duty is to directly be aware directly see of your worry your anxiety that you don't dislike it you are worri about it are you satisfied student number four I have been learning long post teachings for two and a half years and I have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,4623.12,Speaker
previously attended courses in foral practice and in daily life I focus on observing the body when it moves or stays still observing Brave and chanting my question is I have been diligently practicing based on adan's advice may I request aan to assess if there are any areas where I might be stuck on the adjustments actually what I have answered just now is suitable for you your mind is constantly worried why am I not making progress why haven't I realized the path and Achieve attainment why do I improve and then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,4669.04,Speaker
regret and it's happening now is called a worry anxiety see it feel it see that when you feel it the power of the worry lessen is reduced you get brighten lightened you are the worrying type you lo lo loose to this worry and it happen frequently and you are not practicing to see it so you so from now on try to be aware to remember this phenomena until one,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,4714.76,Speaker
point you see that this and then this is something you see it's something dist or is it overcoming your mind at this point there is worry but the power it lessen it get a bit distance okay what you want to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,4761.88,Speaker
[Music] say what my yeah turn on the mic she is worryed that she will get attached to the the peace is she practicing the peace the calmness can can she practice this calmness yes you can but be aware your old habit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,4808.01,Speaker
is love the peace the calm is your old habit it's not bad calmness is good it helps your mind to have a good rest but we don't take Cal calmness for calmness the peace for the happiness from the peace but practice the peace so you have occasional calmness with understanding with wisdom that this calmness is necessary it help so that your mind is energized it's have power not about having happiness from the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,4856.4,Speaker
calm so you will see that this practice with right wisdom with high wisdom not practice for the happiness of theal you practice because it's something needed something necessary that will energize you that will give you power to practice further I have been learning teaching for less than two months and I have not attended any courses in formal practice is I use breathing during sitting meditation and sometime observe body mind and seeing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,4903.92,Speaker
the arising and falling of emotions thoughts or distractions in daily life I try to relax my body and once it has relaxed I shift my attention to observing the Mind observing the arising and falling of emotions and thoughts when I am losing focus on the breathing I will change to chanting puto in my mind and as the object of meditation this practice last for approximately 40 minutes my question is am I practicing correctly and able to see the three CTIC of body and mind please correct me my mistake in my practice yes you have practiced correctly gradually and you can see the aggregate uh operating,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,4951.52,Speaker
your practice is correct keep practicing but from now on what's correct will get lessen because what when I say this is correct you try to keep it you try to fight it to keep it always correct that's that's greed when greed overcome your mind the mindfulness will not arise instead of try to seeing the the Mind work as it is naturally with natural mind you will become a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5006.56,Speaker
practitioner someone who practice practice to obtain something amen see ah you are intending to practice you want to know what he should practice your great in your practice your wanting to improve past everyone has,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5052.48,Speaker
that it cannot be stopped but we can be aware of them remember the principle suffering is to be seen to know the cause of suffering we need to eradicate be aware and eradicate them I will give tell you one story about PA's story when he was a lay man he went to a temple to practice you see the place is so uh so in natural and good for practice so he think okay after I I work something I will come and meditate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5098.96,Speaker
here but then another mon who is who was close by he shout to L PA said you're you're wanting to practice is [Music] wrong why because suffering is to be known to be SE to be understand and the C need to be erucate to this card the onean thing to meditate needs to be discard as well you are aware even you uh you known you are aware of that one thing to practice you you still keep practicing because it's the right thing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5144.68,Speaker
to do if you can see the practice clearly it will not overcome your mind your mind will be normal will be natural it will help your practice to be smoother who have a lot of greed in their practice those people will be harder to practice this is quite difficult to see to observe but it's it's not beyond what you can see you now you want to understand be aware of your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5190.32,Speaker
want my lesson brighten and more comfortable I have been learning L lumu teaching for six years and I have previously attended courses in formal practice I observe the bodily movement during walking meditation and I also recite B during sitting meditation in daily life I use the recitation of B as my meditation object my question is two years ago a John mentioned that I love myself too much and suggested me practice,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5237.0,Speaker
a I have been doing it occasionally I feel my mind to become more neutral to the body of definement mindfulness arrive more frequent in daily life am I practice currently what do I need to improve your practice improved your love for yourself lesson you don't need to be beautiful like like before any dress you can go anywhere in the past if you don't look this level of good you cannot go out of your house see your might reach this point is more comfortable there is less burden,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5286.04,Speaker
and save a lot of money good it's improving how to measure whether you improve or whether you in in the part or not see the burden in your heart are you still a lot of Burden do you let go of your burden in your heart you suffer less see you suffer less and you are cleaner keep practicing is good you need to keep observing your body is good is suitable,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5333.28,Speaker
to you until one point you will see a lot of suffering in your body now you can see a bit keep seeing there's lot of suffering of Burden you need to sh uh shower your hair you need to eat you need to drink drink water after drink water you need to ke then you need to and then you take a bath yeah if it cold you suffer and after you need to cut your hair,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5379.64,Speaker
there's a lot of burdens within daily in your daily life up to one point you see that this body is not something special not something good and then your body age painful and then you won't be suffer that much thank you very much oh very clear tie accent my [Music],https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5427.72,Speaker
pleasure she spoke uh T so I speak Chinese I've been learning Robo teaching for one year and attended courses in former practice I do walking meditation and shouting in daily life I observe the body when it moves or stays still my question is it seems that my mind is still not settled I am unsure whether it's because the method is suitable or if I haven't practiced enough can aan please guide me,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5476.72,Speaker
say if it's not if it's not settle um that's actually it's better than previously it used to sing into the Optics and but it's not stable now but think in the Les lesson level can you just move your mind out inside your mind is still stuck inside can you look at this flower the BL flowers here the Ming out now can can you feel that the mind is more broaden relaxed the manners of the mind is that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5522.04,Speaker
the mind is suppressed inside and it's too deep now now this m is better is more correct do you understand what I'm saying do not try to maintain the mind to guard the mind like this this is what you normally doing it is the feelings of driness and still but strong as well it's actually not good because your mind sending out now your mind moving inside again could you see that no not no,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5567.56,Speaker
that's sing more your mind sings More can you see that yeah you see that could you could you see that once it flows inside your mind gain some weight do you feel that the M moves slower pace did you see that you feel [Music],https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5612.68,Speaker
that now your mind is more outside and the mind can move more quickly right therefore try if you couldn't see the mind that move slowly then once your mind move outside and your mind moves more quickly then you can notice this you can see this then you can imagine that the mind that is normal is Swift the slowness is actually the behavior of the Mind that you are uh tend to normally,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5659.24,Speaker
do she said that I haven't heard your well all everyone's in the hall you forget about yourself in the hall you try to maintain the awareness within yourself just now you forget about yourself you're lost but now you trying to maintain the feelings awareness within your body that's mean you're forcing yourself a little bit could you see that do not it's not it doesn't mean that I forbid you to not being lost or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5708.2,Speaker
moving or focusing but once it lost no so once it's sting out no so once it's forcing itself focusing no so now let let's do this again look at these flowers not do not use the M like this in order to see the flowers you have a lot of intention oh my let's start start again now look at me this person sitting here ah this a lot better you might just out a little bit out more because this person is more attractive than flow,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5754.64,Speaker
flowers we you see that the mind that is out like this is more broaden and can moving more swiftly than the previously let's trying to be aware of the mind that is maintain deep inside like this it seems like you become self aware because there are some weight here that you could feel but actually the mind is submerged is adhere to that weight the mind that moves and submerge in that weight is that the it means that the mind sending out the mind is not stable if the mind sending out doesn't just mean that the mind sending out to see to outside like that but if even if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5803.88,Speaker
the my moves even inside like that means that the M sending out now the m is more correct do you understand I've been learning teaching for three months I have not attended any courses in former practice I of observing the breath reciting meta Sutra and shaba Sutra I observe the arising and passing of thoughts then return to observing the mind in both work and deadly life I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5851.96,Speaker
continuously practice mindfulness of the mind when my mind wonders I try to be aware of it when the mind is to scatter at stop and observe it and this dead will eventually disappear my question is I find it it is challenging to practice myness doing work especially when busy and it feels burdensome can I done please guide me thank you while [Music] working it's difficult to practice dhma because the mind needs to submerge in the world of thoughts especially when your work requires a lot of thinking it's very normal during during work you need to pay attention to your work do not worry about Dharma practice at all just use the mindness and smarty and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5898.0,Speaker
wisdom stays with the work while at that time if your work is not doesn't excite your deferments or or against the morality if your mind accept and relaxed and be and have concentration towards the work after the work done then your mind will gain some strength because you're submerged in a work in one kind of object and that object is not against the morality once the work's finished then you might gain some smart and this kind of smarty is smart that is sending,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5943.12,Speaker
out into one object of meditation this is the uh for the purpose of Comm um but the problem is that you have a lot of War wor that you feel that you need to be self rare as much as possible but when you sing into the world of thoughts while working you cannot accept that once you cannot accept that then the might develop the worriness uh the worries then you want to practice but you can practice because you are worried and your work is not the work is not e is not good because you are you want to practice so if you have to do the work do the work but once the work done you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,5988.48,Speaker
might becomes relaxed no so if you work for a while and you get bored you know so that's correct that's when it's correct do I fix your problem you need to work because you requires money you need money I felt that I've work for too long hours but work for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,6036.44,Speaker
a lot of Works in daily life won't won't um won't negatively affect the Dharma practice if you have if your practice is uh if you have the principle of practice you need to be able to separate between boredom and exhaustion boredom and exhaustion is not the work the extortions make the Mind bolded and unhappy the boldness the mind that lacks of happiness is the defs you need to be aware of it mindful of it it you don't have to develop good feelings it could,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,6083.6,Speaker
be seriousness it could be um boredness or if your mind is relaxed trying to be aware of that a lot of people at work as hours or 10 hours a day they don't work consistently on and on once the might in the worldall of thought then no that's the work but if the laziness happened it's not the work if the fears of not making the good work arises um that's not actually the it's not the work I know One D practitioners and he,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,6130.4,Speaker
practiced very good he work more than 10 hours a day and that person don't even have time to listen to uh listen to Long PA and that person did foral meditation for example walk in meditation less than 1 hour a day but he but um that person practi very good because when the boredness arises that person knows so once becomes uh when they have to when that person needs to walk from one building to another building uh he he knows the body,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,6175.96,Speaker
moving once he want to grab some water he see his body uh grab B with water if he drink water and then the might become refreshing refreshing then he knows that he uh becomes refreshing he go back to work he's practic very good and has a lot of work very busy so the work that is doesn't um that that that is good um there's an abstract Dharma practice if you have to principle of Dharma practice a lot of people think that one,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,6224.64,Speaker
while in dhama practice you need to do form meditation for many hours chanting sitting walking meditation listening to uh D PA for many tracks but that's not entirely true because dhama practice is about your heart so you need to readjust your view towards the dharm practice and then your work will be more but to because the work loss that is too much to large now because your smart is not enough because when you become um serious about the work and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,6270.32,Speaker
then it requires more hours extended hours to complete the work that's all all eight people D practice can helps in worldly Affairs and also D in the worldly Affairs your critical thinking will be more efficient and your smarty will be higher if your smart is stronger then your decision making will be more less,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,6317.0,Speaker
of a bias and you won't waste your time wanting this and that and you and do not know what to want ever your mind would be indecisive whether this one good or not that one good or not that means that your mind is scattered some people develop some bias and you don't know it for example your fear of the works that not going to be okay then you tend to be indecisive and you because you aren't aware of the fear of your heart sometime you're being greedy you want a lot more profit but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,6363.0,Speaker
the puns within your work sample customer space and economics in within the country can only make you gain that level of profit but if you become greedy you want more and more of the profit beyond the conditions of the world you can aware if the greed is aware is is known and it falls away then your um your reasoning will be wiser then so dhma practice helps you both in dhma and worldly Affairs a lot of people who is not succeeded in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,6408.76,Speaker
life is because of defs for example laziness laziness is one kind of definement yeah for example you want to be fun you become selfish you don't have the responsibilities of your of the work that's kind of deferment if you are aware of these departments that arise within your heart that you know that you have duty you are hired to do work you're not hired to practice them within in the company you have duty to work if you're hired to work and you want to practice dhma and you spend hours and hours practicing working together at the same time actually you uh for them cuz you're not hired to you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,6455.52,Speaker
are not hired to practice dhma but but if you at the same time while you're walking in the toilet or drinking coffee and you're moving and you can be self-aware or be happy of the meals and or the satisfaction towards the um the meals that you didn't like you be aware you can be aware of that if you can complete Duty uh in the world then when you once you think of it your mind won't be downhearted if your mind is not downhearted then the mind will gain some strength there's a power or strength of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,6504.4,Speaker
the confidence that there is nothing wrong there's nothing to blame about you if your my G strength and once finish work you can do walking meditation it's the objective of everyone that gaining but as a lay person you have your own Duty as a lay person if you're fathers you got to do the part of your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,6551.8,Speaker
of being father or husband or employers or employees or teachers you need to do your part this is this is when you're completing the task in in the world if you live in the world and you are not responsible for your duty if you want to gain progress in the Dharma then it's I would say that it's difficult because at first you're initially you're already being selfish selfishness isn't it the defs why you're suffering because of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,6597.48,Speaker
defs therefore try to be aware what's behind all action spe and think and thoughts a lot of PE a lot of things that happing seems great but in fact you might be selfish in some aspects for example you don't want to be responsible for some works or taas you want to do sitting or working walking meditation instead of working and you kind push away the uh workloads to other people because of your selfishness while being selfish in you'll take advantage of other people and you want to do practice Dharma you won't make progress because you did this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,6650.36,Speaker
according to your definement the definement is the one actually command your behaviors whatever that you do and the wholesomeness doesn't progress un wholesomeness arise do not do it the behavior of the be body and thoughts and whatever you do shouldn't allow the UN wholesomeness to arise and the must be Prosper the person,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,6696.64,Speaker
that you make contact with the resultant of the the activities shouldn't make those group of people prosper in that deferments so whatever you do and need to need to prosper for both parties this is when you practice Dharma not like going to all day walking sitting meditation for many hours a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,6744.76,Speaker
day the factors that can determine your progress is that with whether your heart is clean or not do you understand is it difficult there's no other options you need to fight for people who think that it's not difficult I share you up no that should be all an everyone,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnvwLm0rU8,6797.04,Speaker
